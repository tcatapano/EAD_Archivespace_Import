 120189 In order to ensure that your container elements import properly, you should assign id attributes for each container grouping per archival component
  49500 You must specify a level attribute at every level of description
   5766 The extent statement should contain more than just an extent number since ArchivesSpace will not import any extent attribute values. If you're making use of the @unit attribute, you would probably be safe in copying that value to the end of the extent's text node (e.g. @unit=&quot;Linear Feet&quot;, 5... could be changed to @unit=&quot;Linear Feet&quot;, 5 Linear Feet)
   5461 The ArchivesSpace EAD importer will silently drop note elements. Please convert these to &quot;odd&quot; elements.
   3090 If the value of a level attribute is &quot;otherlevel', then you must specify the value of the otherlevel attribute
   1589 You must specify either a title or a date when describing archival components (this is a requirement enforced by the AchivesSpace data model, not by EAD)
   1244 'did' elements must contain a either a 'unitdate' element, a 'unittitle' element or both.
    578 'descgrp' is deprecated, and must be removed. Element children of the following types must be reparented into 'descgrp's parent element: 'accessrestrict', 'accruals', 'acquinfo', 'altformavail', 'appraisal', 'custodhist', 'note', 'prefercite', 'processinfo', 'userestrict', 'accessrestrict', 'accruals', 'acquinfo', 'altformavail', 'appraisal', 'custodhist', 'note', 'prefercite', 'processinfo', 'userestrict'
    362 'extent' element content should not start with non-numeric character.
    291 The extent statement must start with a number and it must also have at least one space present. (e.g. &quot;5 Linear Feet&quot; is a valid value, but &quot;5items&quot; is not).
    220 The extent statement must contain more than just an extent number. If you're making use of the @unit attribute, you would probably be safe in copying that value to the end of the extent's text node (e.g. @unit=&quot;Linear Feet&quot;, 5... could be changed to @unit=&quot;Linear Feet&quot;, 5 Linear Feet)
    205 You must supply an extent statement at the resource level. This should be formatted with an extent number and an extent type, like so: &quot;3.25 cubic meters&quot;
    201 'head' element should be dropped from descgrp
    170 Collection level 'did' element must contain 'physdesc' element with 'extent' child.
     57 You must supply an identifier at the resource level
     39 Collection level 'did' element must contain a 'unitid' element.
     18 You must supply a date at the resource level (including as child of unittitle)
