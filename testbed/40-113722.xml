		  SOREM</head> 
		<p>Norah O'Leary was born on January 20, 1909, the eldest daughter of
		  Norbert and Frances "Fanny" O'Leary. The O'Leary family, which eventually
		  included daughters Ruth and Elizabeth (Betty) and a son John, lived in
		  Williston, North Dakota from 1921 until 1925. In 1925 they moved to
		  Worthington, Minnesota where Norbert O'Leary took a job as a district court
		  reporter. Norah entered Worthington high school as a sophomore at the beginning
		  of the 1925-1926 school year and graduated in the spring of 1928. In high
		  school she became friends with Milton Sorem, who was a year or two older. In
		  the fall of 1928 Norah entered Hamline University in St. Paul and graduated
		  four years later. All through college Norah O'Leary and Milton Sorem kept in
		  touch and they married in early June of 1932. </p> 
		<p>A daughter, Gretchen, and a son, Anthony, joined the family in the
		  next few years as Milton worked his way through medical school at the
		  University of Minnesota. He graduated in 1939 and set up a family practice in
		  St. Paul. Despite having two young children, Milton Sorem, and the U.S.
		  government, felt his medical skills were needed more in the Pacific theater for
		  three long years during World War II. After the war, Milton Sorem continued his
		  medical practice in St. Paul, eventually becoming chief of staff at St. Luke's
		  Hospital. Daughters Anita and Alana were born before the Sorems' marriage
		  eventually dissolved. While Norah O'Leary Sorem never remarried or changed back
		  to her birth name, Milton Sorem remarried and helped raise four additional
		  children with his second wife, Evelyn. Milton Sorem died in St. Paul on March
		  4, 1987, about six months shy of his 80th birthday, and Norah O'Leary Sorem
		  died in Minneapolis on January 24, 1989, shortly after reaching her 80th
		  birthday. </p>

		<head id="a3">SCOPE AND CONTENTS</head> 
		<p>This collection consists of the assorted diaries, artwork, mementos,
		  correspondence, and school papers of Sorem from the early 1920s, when she was
		  in her early teens, until the early 1950s. Users of this collection will get a
		  glimpse of what life was like for a high school girl from a rural Minnesota
		  town in the 1920s, college life at Hamline University in St. Paul from 1928 to
		  1932, and what life was like for a mother raising two small children, while her
		  husband was away during World War II. </p> 
		<p>Material is arranged in a more or less chronological order within five
		  sections. Childhood mementos, artwork and writing comprise the first series.
		  Diaries and notebooks from Norah's years in junior high and high school come
		  next. Many of these diaries contain her thoughts about everyday events, friends
		  and family, and her current "heart throb." Correspondence, which comes next,
		  covers some of the same time period as the first two series, but largely
		  contains post-high school correspondence with family, friends, and boyfriend
		  Milton Sorem. The fourth series contains Norah's class papers and mementos from
		  Hamline University. Also included are some papers from graduate school classes
		  in the 1930s, undated writings, and a book of favorite poems. </p> 
		<p>The final series, World War II letters, which date from October 1942
		  to October 1945, document the daily life of a mother with two small children
		  living in St. Paul and trying to cope without their husband and father. This
		  series documents the feelings and daily lives of people left at home during the
		  war. These letters, written almost daily, are quite long and often contain news
		  clippings and cartoons that Norah wanted to share with Milton, and short notes
		  and cards from the two children. While a few letters from Milton to Norah are
		  found here, the rest apparently were destroyed. Some miscellaneous
		  correspondence of Milton Sorem and a sign he saved from the war rounds out the
		  collection. </p>
