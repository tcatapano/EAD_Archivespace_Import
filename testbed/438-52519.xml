                land willed to the Harvard College by Benjamin Bussey. Very soon after, the director
                Charles S. Sargent engaged Frederick Law Olmsted to begin planning the design of the
                grounds. At the same time it was proposed that the Arboretum be combined with the
                Boston Parks System, with the hope that the lands would be protected from
                encroachment, taxation and seizure by eminent domain. The plan was approved by the
                Boston City Council in December 1881 and ratified by the Boston parks commissioners
                and the president of Harvard College in 1882. The plan called for the College to
                sign the title of the land over to the City of Boston and the City to lease the land
                back to Harvard for $1 per year for 1000 years with the lease renewable at that
                time. The City retained lease to the land that was to be made into the Arboretum
                driveways. They also agreed to spend $75,000 to construct those driveways. They were
                to provide policing and promised not to tax the lands or allow any encroachments on
                the property. Harvard agreed to maintain the Arnold and Bussey trusts, maintain the
                living collections and open the grounds to the public at reasonable times.</p></bioghist><scopecontent><p>The bulk of the materials consist of administrative papers relating to the
