He had a dream of industrializing the Southern Amazon region by building railways to carry and distribute goods and materials.  In 1913, the Brazil Railway Company filed for bankruptcy due to the Balkan Wars and a freeze in credit.  A court in Maine appointed W. Cameron Forbes as receiver of the company and he created a reorganization and credit pay back plan for the company.  The Brazil Railway continued to operate until roughly 1940.</p></bioghist><scopecontent><head>Scope and Content Note:</head><p>The records of the Brazil Railway Company include receivership journals, administrative records, financial material, reports, and letters.    The material documents the reorganization of the company after it filed for bankruptcy in 1913 and W. Cameron Forbes' attempt to repay debts and restore the company to a profit making enterprise.  Also included is correspondence of co-receiver Charles E. Perkins and records relating to the Brazil Land, Cattle, and Packing Co., the Madeira-Mamoré Railway, and the Uruguay Railway Company.</p></scopecontent><processinfo><head>Processing Note:</head><p>This collection was previously part of the Forbes family business records.

Cameron Forbes can be found in the Forbes family business records, which are also held at Baker Library.
