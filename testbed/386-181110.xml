		<head>Biographical Sketch of John S. Niederhauser (1916- )</head> 
		<p>John S. Niederhauser was born on September 27, 1916 in Seattle,
		  Washington. He earned his B.S. in 1939 and his Ph.D. in 1943 from Cornell
		  University. He also attended Deep Springs College in California (1933-1935) and
		  Timuryazev All-Union Agricultural Academy in Moscow, Russia (1935-1936). Dr.
		  Niederhauser worked with the Rockefeller Foundation Mexican Agricultural
		  Program (1947-1972) in which he began a potato production program for Mexico
		  and Latin America, in addition to his work on corn, wheat and bean production.
		  His work with potatoes led to an increased production of potatoes in areas
		  where it was not grown before, particularly in Third World countries. He is the
		  recipient of the World Food Prize (1990), founded by Norman Borlaug and awarded
		  to an individual who has made the greatest strides toward ending world hunger.
		  Dr. Niederhauser has also received the World Potato Congress Award (1993) and
		  the Medal of Merit, presented by the Ministry of Agricultural Development of
		  Panama (1996). </p>
