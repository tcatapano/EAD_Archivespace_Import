<abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">Dr. Franklin P. Gates (1859-1922), a native of Kinston, North Carolina established a practice in Manteo after graduating from Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1886.  He was the town doctor until shortly after World War I.  Dr. Wiley Warren Johnston (1885-1978), a native of Brinkleyville, North Carolina, moved to Manteo in 1914 directly out of medical school and joined Gates' practice.  Johnston was called into service in the U. S. Army Medical Corps during World War I, but returned to Manteo and resumed his practice with Gates.  After Johnston's return, Gates began a practice in Norfolk, Virginia.  Dr. Johnston practiced medicine in Dare County for over 40 years and was director of health departments in Dare, Currituck, and Hyde Counties for 25 years.</abstract>

<head>Biographical Note</head>

<bioghist>

<p>Dr. Franklin P. Gates (1859-1922), a native of Kinston, North Carolina and a widower with two children, moved to Manteo to practice medicine after graduating from Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1886.  He was the town doctor until shortly after World War I.</p>

<p>Dr. Wiley Warren Johnston (1885-1978), a native of Brinkleyville, North Carolina, moved to Manteo in 1914 directly out of medical school and joined Gates' practice.  Johnston was called into service in the U. S. Army Medical Corps during World War I, but returned to Manteo and resumed his practice with Gates.  After Johnston's return, Gates began a practice in Norfolk, Virginia.  Dr. Johnston practiced medicine in Dare County for over 40 years and was director of health departments in Dare, Currituck, and Hyde Counties for 25 years.</p>
