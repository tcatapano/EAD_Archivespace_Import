<bioghist><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Merton Howard Miller (1923-2000) was an economist who won the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research in corporate finance.  Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Miller attended Harvard University (A.B., 1944).  In the mid- to late 1940s, Miller worked as an economist for the United States Treasury Department's Division of Tax Research, and the Division of Research and Statistics of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  He earned a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1952, mentored by Fritz Machlup.
</p><p>
</p><p>After graduation from Johns Hopkins, Miller briefly held an appointment at the London School of Economics as an assistant lecturer in American economic history.  In 1953, he moved on to the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie-Mellon University), where he began working with Franco Modigliani on a series of papers on corporate finance.  The two developed the Modigliani-Miller theorem, which holds that under certain assumptions the value of a firm is independent of the firm's ratio of debt to equity.  The Modigliani-Miller theorem is now fundamental to thinking on capital structure.
</p><p>
</p><p>In 1961, Miller accepted a position at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.  While continuing his collaborations with Modigliani, Miller taught business and finance courses, mentored students, served on administrative committees, and conducted further research in corporate finance.  A prolific writer, he often collaborated with other researchers in economics and business, and was a lively and assertive debater.
</p><p>
</p><p>In 1990, Miller's research with Franco Modigliani earned him the Nobel Prize in economics, which he shared with Harry Markowitz and William Sharpe.
</p><p>
</p><p>Miller was active in professional organizations, serving as president of the American Finance Association, on the advisory and editorial boards of several academic publications and organizations. Late in his career, Miller consulted for banks and corporations, and held directorial positions at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  After his retirement, he described himself as a "professional keynote speaker," traveled worldwide to conferences, and spent time on his working farm in Woodstock, Illinois.</p></bioghist>
<scopecontent><head>Scope Note</head><p>This collection documents Merton H. Miller's prolific career as an economist, teacher, consultant, director of financial organizations, and free-market activist. It also contains material broadly related to free-market economics and the Chicago school of economics.  
</p><p>
</p><p>The collection is organized into series to distinguish among different periods and facets of Miller's career.
</p><p>
</p><p>Series I: Education and Early Career, contains material dating from Miller's studies at Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University, his work for the federal government, and his teaching at the London School of Economics.  Materials found in this series span the years 1941-1943, and include notes, exams and papers for classes; a copy of his Ph.D. dissertation, reports, correspondence, and teaching materials such as lecture notes.
</p><p>
</p><p>Series II: Carnegie Institute of Technology, documents Miller's research and teaching during the years 1954-1961. Drafts, correspondence, and research material related to Miller's foundational work with Franco Modigliani is found in this series.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Series III: University of Chicago, is the largest and most diverse series in the collection, documenting Miller's research, teaching and administrative work at the University.  This series also contains material related to lectures, conferences and other non-University of Chicago events that Miller attended in his capacity as a faculty member. This series is divided into six subseries to distinguish among the types of material and levels of restriction included.  Teaching material, research files, publications and drafts, correspondence, administrative records, and video recordings are included in this series.
</p><p>
</p><p>Series IV: Consulting and Professional Activities, contains material related to Miller's activities outside of university teaching, research and speaking. These activities include participation in professional organizations; service on advisory, editorial and governing boards; and consulting for corporations and law firms. This series is divided into three subseries to distinguish among the types of material, and levels of organization and restriction.  The material found in this series includes a large amount of proprietary and confidential information related to legal cases and corporate financing; it also includes correspondence, court documents, publications, drafts and administrative material.
</p><p>
</p><p>Series V: Personal, is a small series containing copies of Miller's CV and list of publications, birthday party memorabilia, and material related to an alumni beer-tasting event.</p></scopecontent>

<did><unittitle>Series III: University of Chicago</unittitle></did>
<scopecontent><p>This series documents Miller's research, teaching and administrative work at the University of Chicago, as well as material related to lectures, conferences and other non-University events that Miller attended in his capacity as a faculty member. This series is divided into six subseries to distinguish among types of material and levels of restriction.</p>
<p>Series III: Subseries 1: Teaching Material, contains material related to courses taught by Miller, business courses, some of which Miller taught for several decades, as well as material for symposia, seminars and other advanced academic courses.  This subseries is divided into two sub-subseries to distinguish between open and unrestricted papers: Sub-subseries 1: General, contains material such as syllabi, reading lists, and lecture notes.  The files in Sub-subseries 2: Restricted, also contain grade reports, evaluated student work, letters of recommendation, and other protected student information.</p>
<p>Series III: Subseries 2: Writing and Research, contains drafts, publications, notes, correspondence and other material related to Miller's academic research and prolific writing of articles, books, and speeches.  Represented here are published and unpublished work from the 1960s-2000s.  Files are organized according to topic or title when identified.  Publication dates and names of co-authors are also given when available.  Miller also filed drafts according to the location in which a speech was given, or by general topic.</p>
<p>Series III: Subseries 3: Correspondence, contains letters and memoranda related to Miller's work in research, writing, teaching and publishing.  Additional correspondence is found throughout the collection; the material included in this subseries includes material maintained by Miller specifically as correspondence files.  This subseries is divided into two sub-subseries to distinguish between types of organization and levels of restriction.  Sub-subseries 1: Subject file, includes correspondence from the 1960s-2000s, and is arranged alphabetically; it is important to note that the subjects described do not always identify the correspondents, but the individuals or organizations discussed.  Referee reports and administrative correspondence are found in this sub-subseries, and are subject to restriction.  Sub-subseries 2: Chronological File, also spans the 1960s-2000s.  This series contains recommendations and other protected student information that is subject to restriction.  </p>
<p>Series III: Subseries 4: Administration, includes correspondence, reports, curriculum and programming material, and other documents related to Miller's service on a variety of university committees and administrative projects.  Many of these administrative activities relate to tenure and appointment procedures. This series contains letters of recommendation, tenure review material, budget material, and other administrative records that are subject to restriction.</p>
<p>Series III: Subseries 5: Arrangements for Speaking Engagements, is arranged chronologically and contains routine organizational material such as itineraries, reservation confirmations, letters of invitation, and expense reports.  Some material on conference proceedings, such as schedules and programs, is also included.  This subseries does not contain drafts, research material, or other substantial documents related to Miller's speeches and presentations - this material is found in Subseries 2.</p>
<p>Series III: Subseries 6: Video Recordings, contains VHS cassette tapes of television broadcasts, conference proceedings, and press conferences in which Miller participated.</p>
