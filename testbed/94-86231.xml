      <p>The Barber School of Speech was founded in Los Angeles in 1922 by Julia Barber, dramatic reader and speech coach. Originally housed in the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music, the school relocated to 1500 South Figueroa Street shortly after its founding, and then to various locations throughout Los Angeles including two locations on Western Avenue.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Barber School of Speech scrapbook contains clippings, announcements, programs, notes, cards, and other types of printed ephemera, 1901-1980 (bulk 1922-1940), collected by Julia Barber, founder and director of the school. The scrapbook documents the activities of Mrs. Barber, a dramatic reader and speech coach, and her colleagues and pupils--their performances, recitals, debates, commencements, and public speaking appearances, both in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States. Many pages are dedicated to the radio appearances of Virginia Barber, especially her role in the KFAC radio presentation of the "The Black Book" written by Barrie Evans (pen name for Miss Barber and her writing partner Eugene Alford) and directed by Julia Barber. Mrs. Barber also identified many specific students, assigning them individual pages in the scrapbook and including not only information about performances but also wedding and birth announcements.</p>
