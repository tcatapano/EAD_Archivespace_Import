The collection traces the organization's development from a nursery to a traditional neighborhood settlement house  and ultimately to a private, non-profit, multi-service center. The following chronology offers  a brief history of SBNH accomplishments.</p><p><chronlist><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1901</date><event>The South Boston Day Nursery (SBDN) is established by Mrs. William Dewart at 418 West 4th Street after several fires kill unattended children in their homes.  Expenses  during its first year of operations, including the hiring of a matron and janitor,  total $663.04.</event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1902-1905</date><event>Olivia Buckminster James, a 27-year-old community volunteer, assumes  responsibility of the nursery  and plays a key role in expanding its programs and services, including the introduction of evening classes in citizenship and cooking for mothers and teens. Under her tutelage,  volunteer Marian J. Homans also assists at the nursery.</event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1907</date><event>SBDN incorporates in Massachusetts for the purpose of "helping poor persons in the care of their children." Mrs. James serves as the first president and remains an active member of the board of directors.  Eventually the  need for a larger facility results in the nursery relocating to 141 I Street.</event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1911-1916</date><event>Forced to move from the I Street location, Olivia and Ellerton James purchase a house and lot at 521 East Seventh Street to avoid further disruptions. They add  a classroom and gymnasium and use the back lot for gardening. The Nursery's name is changed to the South Boston Neighborhood House to reflect its mission of helping people where they live.</event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1917-1927</date><event>
              Male membership in SBNH decreases as a result of recruitment for World War I.  The directors purchase the  adjoining back lot for $360.00.  With the help of donations,  fundraising efforts by the SBNH Mothers' Club, and volunteer labor contributed by students from the
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology
              and
              Harvard University, modernization of  the house begins.
            </event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1929-1932</date><event>During the Great Depression Marian Homans is elected president of SBNH and  works with government programs to assist  laid off workers, including distribution of food baskets by the Mothers' Club.  Graduate students from Wheeler College, Harvard University,  and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology volunteer to teach in order to earn academic credits.</event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1935</date><event>Olivia James dies in 1935, leaving a legacy of $10,000 to SBNH, which is used to pay off the mortgage, make additional renovations, and expand programming.  The organization's  name is changed to the Olivia James House (the "Ollie")   to  honor  her long-term efforts to sustain and expand SBNH.</event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1941-1956</date><event>
              Mary Mooney Perry and Vincent Connors continue to expand programs during the 1940s as World War II generates the need for expanded social services and recreational activities.  The War-Time Recreation Committee of the
              Greater Boston Community Fund
              donates $1,200 to establish a temporary annex at O and Sixth Streets. After it closes, a second building is purchased on Farragut Road in the City Point section of Boston  and named Homans House in honor of Marian J. Homans who retires in 1956.
            </event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1960-1969</date><event>John Howland II is elected president of the Ollie and launches a successful capital campaign that doubles the size of the house, and   increases programs and social services for teens, the elderly and the handicapped. In 1965 the Ollie reverts to its earlier name, the South Boston Neighborhood House.  With increased   funding available from the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity for new programs and services, SBNH  sheds its identity as a traditional settlement house to become a  community-based multi-service center.</event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1971-1975</date><event>Mandated school busing results in heightened tensions as South Boston parents keep their children and teens out of school. SBNH responds by increasing afternoon and evening programs.  Jim Hawks, SBNH president, also launches a major initiative to provide educational counseling.  The "gray power" movement results in the formation of  the Jet Set, senior citizens who play an active role in SBNH affairs.</event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1979-1989</date><event>Reorganization of  SBNH results in the election of    a new board that contains a majority of South Boston residents, including Jim O'Sullivan, John Tynan, and Mary Nee, who participated in SBNH activities as a young girl. State officials contract SBNH to perform a wide range of community services, including daycare, high school equivalency classes, the Jet Set program, family services, and career counseling, raising its annual budget from $200,000 to $1.2 million.</event></chronitem><chronitem><date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1991-1996</date><event>SBNH undergoes retrenchment but  private funding expands.  With the addition of a number of satellite offices in the community, the SBNH expands its services to  more than 3000 residents, providing opportunities for civic, social and educational improvement.</event></chronitem></chronlist></p></bioghist><arrangement><head>ARRANGEMENT</head><p>The collection is arranged in nine series:</p><list><item>
