<abstract encodinganalog="5203_">The Bozeman City Development Plans consist of a collection of maps, profiles, diagrams, proposed land use and subdivision plans, street, sewer, water and utility maintenance and additions. In addition to documents pertaining specifically to Bozeman and Gallatin County, there are a few sets of drawings that document zoning and construction activities in cities elsewhere, likely retained by the Bozeman City Engineer for comparison purposes.</abstract>

<bioghist id="a2" encodinganalog="5451_"><head>Historical Note</head><p>When Bozeman was incorporated in 1883, the streets were supervised by a Street Commissioner under direction of the City Council. On April 20, 1905 the Office of City Engineer was created. His duties encompassed surveys, plats, plans drawings, specifications and estimates connected to the city's needs for all public works. These included supervision of construction and maintenance of streets, alleys, sidewalks, culverts, bridges, sewer and water works systems; surveying necessary for laying off improvements of parks, squares and cemeteries; and establishing the grade of any street, alley or thoroughfare whenever required. He was to keep complete record of his official acts and prepare such maps, plats and profiles as needed for a permanent record. In 1922, the organization of all departments under a Commissioner-Manager Plan was instituted with the duties of the City Engineer remaining essentially the same. On August 21, 1957 Bozeman created a joint City-County Planning Board using the provisions and rights of the Revised Codes of Montana, 1947. The Board's activities absorbed many of the former records of the City Engineer, as well as creating new records which sometimes overlapped. The Board was disbanded and replaced by the Bozeman City Planning Office and the Gallatin County Planning Office in early 1995.</p></bioghist>
<scopecontent id="a3" encodinganalog="5202_"><p>Materials from 1883 to 1992 are included in this collection of maps, profiles, diagrams, proposed land use and subdivision plans, street, sewer, water and utility maintenance and additions. In addition to documents pertaining specifically to Bozeman and Gallatin County, there are a few sets of drawings that document zoning and construction activities in cities elsewhere, likely retained by the Bozeman City Engineer for comparison purposes. The various items of this collection were arbitrarily assigned consecutive numbers on their initial inventory. Rather than look for specific patterns among the materials to form individual series based on genre or function, it was decided to retain the inventory numbering and assign various subject headings to the individual drawings that would allow their sorting by geographic area or subjects such as "Buildings and Structures" or "Water, Sewer and Gas". Geographic locations of the drawings are based on a division of Bozeman at the intersection of Main Street and Tracy Avenue, with the drawings placed in either the northwest, northeast, southeast, or southwest quadrants, or north and south of Main Street, or east and west of Tracy Avenue. Other geographic locations include the greater Gallatin County area, and cities beyond.</p></scopecontent>
