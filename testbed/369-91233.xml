            <p>The Papers of the Cavendish-Talbot family were acquired in May 1961 from the booksellers Lionel and Philip Robinson.</p>

            <head>Provenance</head>
            <p>The Papers of the Cavendish-Talbot family form part of the Phillipps' collection, nos. 20556-20558.</p>
            <p>Many of the papers are included in Joseph Hunter's 
                <title render="italic">History of Hallamshire</title> (see bibliography) and belonged to John Wilson of Broomhead Hall (1719-1783). Wilson had acquired these from a Mr. Stainforth of Darnell, a Mr. Bosville of Gunthwaite and Sir Thomas Wentworth of Bretton, and as two groups in this collection are letters to and/or from a John Stainforth and various members of the Wentworth families, it seems probable that they all formed part of the same collection. Wilson's collection was still intact in 1806; in 1843 it was dispersed and sold to Mr. Thorpe, a London bookseller, who sold many items to James Newman of High Holborn and he in his turn to Sir Thomas Phillipps. A.N.L. Munby describes their provenance as "Ex bibl. Miscellaneous."</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The Papers of the Cavendish-Talbot family contain 175 autograph letters signed, as well as various financial documents, warrants, petitions, orders, physician instructions and other miscellaneous documents relating to the Cavendish, Talbot, Wentworth, and Slingsby families as well as to Sir Humphrey Style, and Stanley Gower.</p>
            <p>Divided into six series: Cavendish and Talbot family papers, 1548-1607; Wentworth family papers, [1542?], 1624-1705; Slingsby family of Scryven papers, 1586-1634; Sir Humphrey Style letter, ca. 1629; Stanley Gower papers, 1636-1658; and miscellaneous documents, 1500-1548.</p>
            <p>Most of the papers are autograph letters; several are written by an amanuensis and signed by the writer. Well-known place-names and personal names are modernized. Dates when not given are supplied, often tentatively, with a few given as undated. If a wax seal on a letter is whole and undamaged, this is noted. Additional manuscripts relating to the Countess of Shrewsbury appear in the Related Materials section of this finding aid.</p>
            <p>Series 1: The Cavendish and Talbot family papers contain letters and miscellaneous documents. The majority of the letters are addressed to Elizabeth Hardwick Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury, either as Lady Cavendish, Lady St. Loe, or as Countess of Shrewsbury, and are from her family and friends. Many mention Lady Arbella Stuart, the Countess of Shrewsbury's grand-daughter. Some are instructions to her steward and men of affairs and mention matters concerning the running of the estates and the building of Chatsworth. Others, particularly those from her stepson Gilbert Talbot, her daughter Mary, and her sons Charles and William, give her a survey of the news of the day, and events at court. The Wingfields answer at some length enquiries as to suitable New Year's gifts for the queen. Though Mary, Queen of Scots, was in the keeping of her husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, during much of the time covered by the letters, there are few references to her, although two well-known letters in which the Earl tells of the possibility and then the certainty of Mary, Queen of Scots, being put in his charge are in this collection. A few refer to the differences which arose between the Earl and Countess. There are several household accounts, and an inventory of the goods of Francis Talbot, deceased. Twenty-three of the letters are written by women, including the Countesses of Kent, Lennox, Northumberland and Shrewsbury (both Elizabeth and her daughter Mary); Grace Cavendish; Lady Frances Cobham; Elizabeth (Leake) Leche; Lady Frances Pierrepont; Lady Margaret St. Loe; Lady Dorothy Stafford; Anne Talbot; and Elizabeth Wingfield.</p>
            <p>Series 2: The Wentworth family papers contain letters and miscellaneous documents. There were many Wentworths in Yorkshire, including the Wentworths of Elmsall and Broadsworth, the Wentworths of West Bretton, the Wentworths of South Elmsall, and the Wentworths of Woolley. Most of these letters are to and from the Wentworths of West Bretton and Woolley. There are two from William Wentworth, later 2nd earl of Strafford, and some accounts on matters affecting his estates. Two orders are signed by Sir Thomas Wentworth, later Earl of Strafford; one by John Lambert. Some letters bear postal markings: X.d.428 (149, 156, 158, 168).</p>
            <p>Series 3: The Slingsby family letters contain letters of the Slingsby family of Scriven, Yorkshire. Most are to Sir Henry Slingsby (d. 1634, father of Sir Henry 1602-1658) from other members of the family. A number arise out of his vice-presidency of the Council of the North and concern parliamentary affairs. Correspondents include Sir Henry Slingsby, his father Francis, his brother Sir William, his nephews Guilford and Sir Robert, his cousins William Byrnand and Sir Francis Trappes-Byrnand, his son-in-law Sir Thomas Metcalfe, his grandson Sir George Marwood, and his cousin Henry, Earl of Northumberland. Other correspondents are Sir Charles Cavendish, Peter Benson, Thomas, Lord Fairfax, Sir John Gibson, Christopher Mather, Robert Norton, Phanuell Otbie, Sir Robert Cecil, later Earl of Salisbury, Christopher Wade, Thomas Wardropp, Edward Wilson, Samuel Wortley, and William Wycliffe. A few of the letters are sent to/from Dublin.</p>
            <p>Series 4: Sir Humphrey Style letter is to his wife Elizabeth.</p>
            <p>Series 5: The Gower family letters are from Stanley Gower and his wife to their close friends John and Mary Stainforth of Darnall, Yorkshire, 1636-1658. Stanley Gower was rector of Brampton Bryan, Herefordshire, and his patron was first Sir Robert Harley and then Sir Edward Harley. Several letters refer to the disturbances of the civil wars, but not to the prolonged siege in 1643.</p>
            <p>Series 6: The Miscellaneous documents consist of a copy of a lease, will, and receipt, apparently unrelated to any of the above families.</p>

            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>Originally bound in three volumes enclosed in a large red box resembling a volume. The papers had been numbered in pencil and were in sequence but as there was no discernible order in the arrangement and as many had become detached and were in need of repair, the volumes were broken up and the letters were divided into six series by family, with unrelated items placed in Series 6: Miscellaneous documents.</p>
            <p>Within each series, the correspondence is arranged alphabetically by writer, with unidentified writers appearing at the end of the series, and then chronologically. Series 1: Cavendish-Talbot family papers and Series 2: Wentworth family papers are divided into two subseries: 1.1 Correspondence and 1.2 Other documents. The papers in the other documents subseries, as well as Series 6: Miscellaneous documents, are arranged chronologically.</p>

The duke [of Norfolk] was committed to the Tower, most likely because he sent money to assist the Scottish lords, who sided with Mary, Queen of Scots. The Queen is to go to Lord Burleigh's on Sunday, where the Earl of Oxford is to marry Burleigh's daughter. In news from France, there is "nothing spoken of the Quenes Maiesties marriage." The murderer of the Earl of Lennox has been executed.</p>

                            <p>Some enclosures near Lincoln were thrown open by certain unruly persons. Parliament sits with little to do. A new Lord Chief Justice of England (Sir Thomas Fleming) and Lord Chief Baron (Justice Tanfield) were named. The King will soon go to Theobalds, and then the Isle of Wight, on a progress. The King has placated the Lord Treasurer with a diamond.</p>

                            <p>Reports on a dispute over land involving herself and others in which he is trying to act as an intermediary. Refers to her husband as "my Lorde your Beadfelow." Beseeches her to use the young gentleman, Master Pierrepont (Perpoynte), "as gently as ye can, that we may wynne hym." Has heard that Anne Perpont? is in love with one Texle; if this be so then the hope of Mr. Chaworth "that wayse ys dawnted." Master Perpont? has a book of his called "Gallen in Phesycke." Her two sweet children are in health. P.S., a proverb: "by close dealyng, a man may come to a kyngdom."</p>

                            <p>Still delayed with daily promises in trying to dispatch their business. The Earl of Essex was going to renew his suit to the queen for Tutbury, but is willing to "surcease" his suit to further Gilbert therein. Description of the wicked murder of the French king, by a friar, it is thought. P.S. in Mary's hand: Nothing has been performed "for your ladyship's case;" concerning Welbeck, "it is much mor bacward then it semed;" the Queen has asked very carefully after Lady Arbella.</p>

Asks her not to share the news of the Queen's expressing her care of Arbella with others.</p>

All are well at Hackney (the Lennox's), and Lady Arbella is a good child. Asks after Lord George (her grandson, the son of Gilbert and Mary, who died in 1577, age 2.)</p>

Upon the serving of the king's letter yesterday, he wrote to Peter Benson that he could say nothing, and if nothing but his oath will satisfy Benson, Benson must procure a commission.

                        <p>He cannot write much because he has "such a payne in my head." Henry Benson has brought him a letter, dated April 1612, from Sir Francis to his father Peter Benson, in which Sir Francis declared Sir Henry's consent to "certayn thinges agreed to betweene your self and him." Henry Benson would not show him the letter until Sir Francis promised to return it to him undefaced, and mentioned another incriminating letter in Sir Henry's hand to Sir Francis. This requires consideration, and he wishes that they might all speak together.</p>

Stanley has sent his goddaughter "a little psalme booke, which I hope by this tyme shee can make vse of," and Sarah has sent her godson an "AEols blast out of a payre of bellows."</p>

"Our plundered condition maks vs keepe but one mayd," but John's daughter's ability in reading, writing, sewing, and starching "will render hir acceptable in very good places." They expect the arrival of the Scottish Commissioners, "then both kingdoms send propositions to the King." Some members of the House of Commons have ordered Sir Thomas Fairfax to send soldiers into Ireland: the Presbyterian party obeys, the Independents demur and prepare a mutinous petition.</p>
