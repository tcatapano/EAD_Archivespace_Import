		<p>Oscar Ferdinand Youngdahl was born on October 13, 1893 in Minneapolis,
		  the son of John C. and Elizabeth (Johnson) Youngdahl. He graduated from
		  Gustavus Adolphus College (St. Peter, Minn.) in 1916 and served in the U.S.
		  Navy during World War I. He graduated from the Minnesota College of Law in 1925
		  and was a partner in the Minneapolis law firm of Tifft and Youngdahl from 1930
		  on.</p> 
		<p>Youngdahl, a Republican, was elected to Congress from Minnesota's
		  fifth district in 1938 and served two terms. He died in Minneapolis on February
		  3, 1946.</p>

		<head id="a3">SCOPE AND CONTENTS</head> 
		<p>Youngdahl's constituent newsletters reflect the principal political
		  and economic interests of the period, especially American neutrality during the
		  early years of World War II. There is much discussion of the proposed abolition
		  of the Arms Embargo Act, the Lend-Lease Act, armed convoys for merchant ships,
		  and similar issues, all of which were opposed by Youngdahl. There is also
		  information on defense spending, welfare and public relief programs, changes in
		  the Hatch Act, the Democratic and Republican national conventions of 1940,
		  selective service legislation, and the issues of enemy aliens and actions
		  against subversive activities (Dies Committee).</p>
