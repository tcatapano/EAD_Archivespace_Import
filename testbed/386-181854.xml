		<head altrender="history" id="a2h">HISTORY OF YMCA OF GREATER NEW YORK
		  BRANCHES</head> 
		<p>The YMCA of Greater New York is the amalgamation of several local
		  associations in what later become the five boroughs of New York City. Shortly
		  after its founding in 1852, the New York Association was joined by the Brooklyn
		  Association, as well as by associations in Williamsburg, Staten Island,
		  Greenpoint, New Utrecht, Harlem and on Grand Street and Varick Street -- all
		  before 1869. In the years that followed, more YMCAs were formed as branches of
		  the parent organizations of New York and Brooklyn. In addition, independent
		  YMCA organizations merged with the New York or Brooklyn associations to become
		  branches; both the New York and Brooklyn associations adopted the
		  "metropolitan" model of organization by 1896. The growth of the YMCA in New
		  York can be seen in the opening and closing of branches that continued to occur
		  into the 21st century. Just as the New York Y added or changed programs to meet
		  the needs of the community, the organization added, moved and closed branches
		  whenever it felt that the mission and goals of the YMCA were best served by
		  change. </p> 
		<p>As a result, some YMCA branches in New York were short-lived,
		  primarily because their initial promise was not borne out by membership and
		  program participation. Other YMCA branches were victims of changing
		  demographics. For example, the original Harlem branch did not serve
		  African-Americans in the 19th century; that role was performed by the Colored
		  Men's branch located 60 blocks to the south. Harlem became an African-American
		  neighborhood in the 20th century, and the YMCA responded to the change by
		  opening a new branch and closing the original Harlem branch. Services formerly
		  provided by the old Harlem branch were subsequently carried out by the Uptown
		  branch. </p> 
		<p>In addition to serving neighborhoods throughout New York, the YMCA
		  established highly specialized branches. These included railroad branches for
		  railroad men, branches for people of specific ethnicity or nationality,
		  branches for college students and branches for members of the armed services.
		  When the need for branches such as these lessened, the Y did not hesitate to
		  move its resources to address current, rather than past, concerns. For example,
		  after WWII, the Y reduced or eliminated programs and branches for servicemen.
		  As the number of railroad workers declined, the special branches catering to
		  railroad employees were closed. </p> 
		<p>The ability of the YMCA to adapt to changing needs and circumstances
		  is well illustrated by the history of its branches. </p>
