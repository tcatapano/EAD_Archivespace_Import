<abstract label="Abstract">The California State Railroad Museum Library's railroad film collection includes film and video documenting railroad operations and history, primarily in California and Western states, though also in some other geographic regions. The collection includes both commercial and amateur film and video footage. Some topics covered include railroad facilities, steam and diesel locomotives, freight and passenger trains, railroad instructional films, streetcars, train robberies, logging railroads, tourist railroads, and railfan excursion trips. Content of particular northern California interest includes construction of the Oroville dam, railroad ferries in the San Francisco Bay area, and trips aboard well-known named trains, such as the "California Zephyr" with its dome cars. Also included are videos of some the Museum's institutional history.</abstract>
