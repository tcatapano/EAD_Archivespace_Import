<abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="520">This small collection reflects William Brown Terrell's lifelong interest in Elon College affairs, particularly documenting his active participation during his student years and his involvement with the Alumni Association. Although some of the items-mainly photographs-represent the years that W. B. Terrell studied at Elon College in the 1920s, the majority of materials reflect his interest in the college generally, spanning the years from the 1900s into the 1980s. The collection is arranged alphabetically by type of material into four series, then chronologically, if applicable. These series are: Books; Literary Productions; Photographs; and Printed Materials.</abstract>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>This collection contains items primarily about Elon College spanning a broad range of years, from the 1900s to the 1980s. The collection contains some items, mainly photographs, from the years the William Brown Terrell attended Elon College; however, it mainly reflects Mr. Terrell's lifelong interest in Elon College affairs, particularly his involvement with the Alumni Association. The collection is arranged alphabetically by type of material into four series, then chronologically where applicable. These series are: Books; Literary Productions; Photographs; and Printed Materials.</p>
<p>The smallest series, Literary Productions, contains two essays (2:1). One of these essays was written by historian Durward T. Stokes, author of <title render="italic">Elon College: Its History and Traditions</title>. This essay provides a historical account of Brick Church, in Guilford County, from its origins in the 1770s until the early 1980s, when the essay is likely to have been written. The other document describes the kidnapping of Elon College alumna Maedell Lambeth, in 1934. This essay has neither author nor date attached, but is likely to have been penned in the early 1980s as well, judging by the story's references.</p>
<p>The largest series is Photographs, containing sixteen black-and-white images of Elon College people and buildings. The majority of these photographs are from the 1920s, including one image of Old Main burning in 1923 (3:1). There are two class photographs-Freshman Class, 1901-02 and Sophomore Class, 1905 (3:2)-as well as the Burlington Club, 1923 (3:1.1), of which W. B. Terrell was president. There are a few undated images (3:3), some of which also appear to have been taken in the 1920s. Several of the photographs in this collection can be found in different issues of the yearbook <title render="italic">Phi Psi Cli</title>, in other manuscript collections, or in the Elon Archives' Photograph Collection.</p>
<p>The Books series includes Elon College publications dating from 1912 to 1919 (1:1), before W. B. Terrell was a student.  There are five Elon College Bulletins, each being unique issues that do not follow the traditional college catalogue format that the majority of Elon College Bulletins adhere to. These issues are titled <title render="italic">Special Funds Number</title>, 1912; <title render="italic">Opening Number</title>, 1913; <title render="italic">Vacation Number</title>, 1913; <title render="italic">Mid-Vacation Number</title>, 1916; and <title render="italic">Special Christian Education Number</title>, 1919. Each of these bulletins contains speeches and sermons presented to students, as well as some photographs. The two remaining items in this series are duplicate copies of the 1915 yearbook, <title render="italic">Phi Psi Cli</title> (1:2).</p>
<p>The final series, Printed Material, primarily contains newspaper articles about Elon College. The majority of these articles highlight events dating between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s. One news item is about the hiring of L. H. (Hap) Perry as the football head coach in 1946 (4:3); another discusses music professor Malvin N. Artley's violin repair workshop (4:2). The remaining news articles are about Elon College president James Earl Danieley's retirement in 1973 and the donation of the Bob Crumpton Home to Elon College in 1974 (4:4). The most unique item in this series is the <title render="italic">Souvenir Library Bulletin</title>, 1924, dedicated to the opening of the Carlton Library. This special bulletin contains photographs of the Carlton family, the dedication speech presented by Louis R. Wilson, and a brief history of the library's establishment (4:1).</p>

<p>This series, Books, contains Elon College publications in the form of bulletins and yearbooks. There are five bulletins (<title render="italic">Special Funds Number</title>, 1912; <title render="italic">Opening Number</title>, 1913; <title render="italic">Vacation Number</title>, 1913; <title render="italic">Mid-Vacation Number</title>, 1916; and <title render="italic">Special Christian Education Number</title>, 1919), as well as two copies of the 1915 yearbook, <title render="italic">Phi Psi Cli</title>. These publications describe the religious, academic, political, and social life at Elon College during those years. The bulletins are unique issues that do not follow the form of the traditional college catalogue. The <title render="italic">Special Funds Number</title> of March 1912 lists financial contributions to the college, while the remaining issues contain addresses, sermons, and speeches presented to students, as well as photographs of the college and its students. The yearbook highlights student life, including organizational and athletic activities, and provides photographs of students, faculty, and staff. Some of these items are stored offsite; however, where this is the case, a "public use" copy is available in the Archives room in the library.</p>

<p>The Literary Productions series is the smallest in the collection, containing only two essays. One essay is titled "History of Brick Church," and was written by historian Durward T. Stokes, alumnus, emeritus professor of history, and author of <title render="italic">Elon College: Its History and Traditions</title>. The essay traces the history of one Guilford County church from its origins in the 1770s to 1981. The essay is undated but is likely from early 1980s. The second essay, "Elon Co-ed Kidnapped," bears neither author nor date; but is likely to have been written after 1980, based on its references. This essay describes the holdup of a Burlington Mills office and the kidnapping of Elon alumna Maedell Lambeth and her coworker, Miss Eckner, in August 1934.</p>

<p>The largest series in the collection, Photographs, contains images documenting Elon College, primarily in the 1920s during the years that William B. Terrell attended.  There are exterior images of various buildings, including one of the Old Main administrative building burning during the fire of 1923. This photograph is printed in the yearbook <title render="italic">Phi Psi Cli</title> of that year. There is one 1926 image of the interior of Whitley Auditorium which captures Rev. James W. "Uncle" Wellons preaching on his 100th birthday. [This photograph, and further details of this event, can also be found in the James Willis Wellons Collection, Mss.Coll.#006.] Several of the photographs document Elon College students; specifically, there are two class photographs from 1901 and 1905 and one of the Burlington Club of 1923, of which W. B. Terrell was president. Also included are several unidentified group photographs and an assortment of images depicting Elon students.</p>

<unittitle>4. Printed Material. Inclusive: <unitdate type="inclusive">1924-1974.</unitdate> Bulk: <unitdate type="bulk">1960s-1970s.</unitdate></unittitle>
<physdesc><extent>4 Folders. 7 Items.</extent></physdesc>
</did>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series, Printed Material, is predominantly comprised of newspaper articles, the majority of which date approximately from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>The most unique item is the <title render="italic">Souvenir Library Bulletin</title>, a 1924 bulletin of Elon College dedicated to the opening of the Carlton Library. This booklet describes the events leading up to the need for a new library and the dedication of the building, and also gives a detailed description of the library. The full text of the dedication speech titled "The Place of the Library in College Life," given by Louis R. Wilson, Librarian of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is included. Photographs of the new library and members of the Carlton family are interspersed throughout the bulletin as well.</p>
<p>The remaining items document events at Elon College. One 1946 news item announces L. J. (Hap) Perry as the new football head coach. A second article (undated, ca. 1966-1971) describes the violin repair workshop of music professor Malvin N. Artley. Two items document Dr. James Earl Danieley's retirement as Elon College's president in 1973. The remaining two articles announce the gift of the Crumpton House, located in Person County, NC, to Elon College in 1974. These articles describe the history of the property and announce plans for its use as the Crumpton Conference Center. Further details about the Crumpton Conference Center can be found in the "Crumpton House" campus buildings vertical file in the Archives room in the Library.
