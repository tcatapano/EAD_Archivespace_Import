One image is the interior of an unidentified bar with Bouhan and several unidentified men, circa 1940s. The other image is of Bouhan, Harry S. Truman, and an unidentified man in a car during the Savannah, Georgia, St. Patrick’s Day Parade, circa 1962. The image is signed on the front, “To My Friend John, Harry S. Truman”.</p>
