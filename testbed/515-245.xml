            <p>James Austin Williams was born in Mitcheldean, England, on April 19, 1876, and died sometime after 1934. He moved to Winnipeg with his parents at age ten, and at eighteen served as assistant postmaster at Manitou and also worked for a general merchant. After studying music in Winnipeg he moved to Minneapolis in 1897 to continue his studies, finding employment with a manufacturer or rope and twine.</p>
            <p>After traveling and singing through a lyceum bureau, he opened his own studio in 1900 and became conductor of The Philharmonic Club and sang tenor at the Church of the Redeemer, in Minneapolis. Later, he became director and choirmaster at Gethsemane Episcopal Church (his "headquarters"), Wesley M. E. Church, and Immanuel Norwegian Lutheran Church, all also in Minneapolis. At some time, he also served as director of the Central High Glee Club. He married, and by 1937 another man was serving as choirmaster at Gethsemane.</p>
