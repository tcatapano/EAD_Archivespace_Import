        which opened at the London Palladium on 17 Dec 1974 and ran for 383 performances. A revival opened in London on 17 Dec 1977 and closed on 28 Feb 1978.  Includes contracts signed by Alyn Ainsworth, Willougby Goddard, Sally Ann Howes, Milo O'Shea, Albin Pahernik, and Anthony Valentine. 
        The stage musical was based on the 1952 screen musical <title xlink:type="simple">Hans Christian Andersen, </title>
        produced by Sam Goldwyn and including music and lyrics by Frank Loesser.</p></scopecontent><bioghist><head>Historical Note</head><p>In 1952 lyricist and composer Frank Loesser was hired by film producer Samuel Goldwyn to write the songs for his movie <title xlink:type="simple">Hans Christian Andersen, </title>
    starring Danny Kaye in the title role. Though critics did not hold the screenplay in high regard, they praised Loesser's score and Kaye's performance.
    In 1974, five years after her husband's death, Loesser's widow, Jo Sullivan, was instrumental in bringing about a stage version of the work, titled <title xlink:type="simple">Hans Andersen, </title>
        at the Palladium in London. Though drawing on a book by TOmmy Steele and Beverly Cross, it was based on Goldwyn's movie. Loesser's songs were retained, with additional songs by Marvin Laird.
        Produced by Harold Fielding (in association with Louis Benjamin), and directed by Freddie Carpenter, the cast included Tommy Steele as
        Hans Andersen, Colette Gleeson as Jenny Lind, Milo O'Shea as Otto Pedersen, Bob Todd as Meisling and Lila Kaye as Madame Meisling. The musical was revived
        at the Palladium on 17 Dec 1977, with Tommy Steele as Hans Andersen, Sally Ann Howes as Jenny Lind, Anthony Valentine as Otto Pedersen, and Lila Kaye as Madame Meisling.
     
    </p><p>Harold Fielding (1916-2003) was one of the foremost producers of stage musicals in Britain from the 1950s to the 1980s. After some success
        as an orchestral and concert promoter he made his first foray into musical theater in 1958 with a staged version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's 
        <title xlink:type="simple">Cinderella </title> at the London Coliseum. Among his most successful theater productions were the original <title xlink:type="simple">Half a Sixpence </title>
        (1963), <title xlink:type="simple">Charlie Girl </title> (1965), the London versions of <title xlink:type="simple">Sweet Charity </title> (1967), and <title xlink:type="simple">Mame </title>
        (1969). </p></bioghist><controlaccess><head>Controlled Access </head><p>The following catalog entries represent persons, organizations, and topics
