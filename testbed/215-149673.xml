			<p>Officially organized on March 22, 1877, the Lone Star Real Estate and Colonization Company, a land speculation firm, operated until 1904.  Though it had an office in Austin, Texas, the company's owners, including president T. C. Reade, secretary T. S. Milhouse, vice-president and attorney A. P. Ashbrook, and treasurer W. P. Milhouse, controlled the company from Indiana and Ohio.  Between 1878 and 1880, the Lone Star Real Estate and Colonization Company patented approximately 131 sections of Texas land in the name of the company and its officers under the Fifty Cent Act, which sold Texas public lands at fifty cents an acre to finance the public debt and a permanent school fund.</p>
