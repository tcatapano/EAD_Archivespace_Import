		  newsman, Jack Webster) and Channel 12 Specials. Channel 12 Specials comprise
		  interviews and documentaries about significant events and issues in Washington

      <p>In 1953 the Federal Communications Commission issued a license for
		  television station KVOS-TV to operate in Bellingham, Washington. Owned by local
		  businessman and entrepreneur Rogan Jones - then the owner of KVOS radio -
		  KVOS-TV broadcast its first program on May 23, 1953, featuring the coronation
		  of British monarch Queen Elizabeth II. </p>
      <p>Despite Jones' conviction that television could succeed in a city as
		  small as Bellingham, the station had early difficulties supporting itself. In
		  1955, Jones responded by establishing an advertising company, KVOS-TV (B.C.)
		  Limited, in Vancouver, British Columbia. The company produced revenue by
		  selling advertising and producing commercials for Canadian businesses. KVOS-TV
		  continued to broadcast from Bellingham, with much of its audience based in
		  British Columbia's Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island. </p>
      <p>In 1962 Rogan Jones sold KVOS-TV to the WOMETCO Corporation. KVOS-TV
		  is owned currently by Clear Channel International's entertainment and media
		  group. Rogan Jones' former radio stations currently operate under the call
		  letters of KGMI and KISM but are no longer affiliated with KVOS Television.

      <p> The KVOS Channel 12 Film Records comprise select reel-to-reel footage
		  from KVOS television programs The Webster Reports and Channel 12 Specials,
		  broadcast between 1961-1967. A monthly show hosted by Vancouver, B.C. newsman
		  Jack Webster, The Webster Reports programs combine human interest stories with
		  more serious reporting about regional news and events in British Columbia.
		  Channel 12 Specials contain interviews and documentaries, many pertaining to
		  current affairs and local issues in Washington State.</p>
      <p>The Webster Reports include "Century 21" (1962), regarding the Seattle
		  World's Fair, as well as programs "A Case of Terror" (1962) and "Road to
		  Nowhere" (1963), about the activities of the Doukhobor sect, The Sons of
		  Freedom, in British Columbia. "The Eye of the Storm" (1963 focuses on the B.C.
		  Prison hostage crisis, in which Webster was both a negotiator and hostage. The
		  Webster Reports also contain a 1963 profile of Christian evangelist and
		  fundamentalist Billy James Hargis. </p>
      <p>Channel 12 Specials include a feature on the Seattle World's Fair
		  entitled "Girls, Glitter and Gracie" (1962), footage of the 1964 Alaska
		  Earthquake and programs about issues affecting local public schools and
		  colleges in Bellingham, Washington. "The Color of Black" (1965), features an
		  interview with James Leonard Farmer, Jr, founder and head of the Congress of
		  Racial Equality (CORE). Many of the Channel 12 Specials programs were broadcast
		  live and later taped to video. Most were produced by Al Swift, U.S. Congressman
		  and former News Director of KVOS. The majority were recorded in black and
		  white, with a few later episodes in color. </p>
      <p>All reels in the KVOS Channel 12 Film records are 16mm film format.
		  KVOS's original organizational numbering system is reflected in the description
		  of each reel in the collection inventory. Researchers should note that the
		  collection does not contain any supporting or textual documentation regarding
		  the programs or film footage. The Rogan Jones Papers at the Center for Pacific
		  Northwest Studies contain additional information about KVOS television. </p>

				  Doukhobor community. The Doukhobors were a group of religious Russian
				  immigrants, and the “Sons of Freedom” sect had been accused of terrorism at the
				  time. Topics include recent arrests of Doukhobor members, possibility of
				  emigration from Canada, freedom of education, culpability for financial losses
				  resulting from destructive protests, and the chosen simplicity of the Doukhobor
				  way of life. For more Doukhobor footage, see W-4, W-15, and W-26. </p>

				  three union officials during the 1962 Canadian Labor Congress. The topic is the
				  degree to which Canadian union members are beholden to U.S. laws, policies, and
				  direction in international unions with U.S. headquarters (AFL CIO). While all
				  three guests defend Canadian union autonomy and minimize the extent of U.S.

				  Crusade, are devoted to denouncing communism. The first five minutes are
				  footage of Hargis delivering his anti-communist sermon, during which he calls
				  Khrushchev a “demon-possessed man,” and labels communism as an “international
				  Satanic conspiracy.” Other subjects condemned by Hargis include liberalism,
				  socialism, academic freedom, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, the American
				  Black Moslem (Muslim) movement, Canadian trade with China, and rapid racial
				  integration. Webster also grills Hargis about fundraising questions, racist
				  remarks made by his supporters, and his support for a new invasion of Cuba to
				  oust Fidel Castro. Hargis supports a boycott on goods produced in communist
				  nations, such as Polish Hams. It is mentioned that the then Washington State
				  Democratic Party Chairman (name unclear) walked out on Hargis’ sermon, calling
				  it a “perversion of Christianity.” </p>

				  into two equal parts, and features guests discussing two unrelated topics. The
				  first in Felix Green, who discusses his book <emph render="italic">The Curtain
				  of Ignorance</emph> and issues surrounding Canadian relations with and
				  perceptions of communist China. Topics include Mao Tse-Tung (Mao Zedong) and
				  the potential threat posed to the United States and Canada by China. The second
				  is noted journalist and author Pierre Berton, who discusses his most recent and
				  most controversial book <emph render="italic">The Comfortable Pew</emph>.
				  Although commissioned by the Anglican Church, the book is a scathing critique
				  of Christianity. Topics include religion, anti-religion, atheism, agnosticism,
				  morals, and the sexual revolution. Berton puts Webster in the hot seat by
				  skillfully exposing his hypocrisies. For more Pierre Berton footage see W-20.

				  old Steven Truscott, in 1959, had been convicted of the rape and murder of his
				  twelve year old schoolmate Lynne Harper. But LeBourdais was convinced that the
				  trial had been a miscarriage of justice, and that Truscott, then the youngest
				  person ever on Canada’s death row, was innocent. She spent four years
				  researching and gathering evidence before releasing the book. However, despite
				  the compelling evidence in LeBourdais’ book, Truscott never received a new
				  trial. Although paroled in 1969, Truscott still struggles to clear his name
				  today (2005). An unnamed individual replaces Jack Webster as interviewer on
				  this episode. </p>

				  to a ceremony held at the Peace Arch on September 22, 1962, celebrating the
				  civil defense cooperation agreement recently signed between Washington State
				  and British Columbia. Specifically aimed at enhancing cross-border coordination
				  in the event of a nuclear attack, a key provision of the treaty calls for a
				  Vancouver evacuation route to run through Whatcom County: up H Street in
				  Blaine, and on to Sumas. Footage shows Canadian and American politicians
				  hammering nails to erect a dispersal route sign at the border. Footage includes
				  short speeches made by several officials praising international cooperation,
				  both the interior and exterior of the Washington State Civil Defense Mobile
				  Command Post bus, Canadian and American troops marching back and forth under
				  the Peace Arch while a marching band plays, and food being prepared for and
				  eaten by the troops. Amongst several people interviewed are British Columbia
				  Provincial Secretary W.D. Bligh and Washington State Lieutenant Governor John
				  Sherbert. </p>

				  Nuclear Physicist Dr. William G. Pollard is interviewed throughout this
				  episode. Pollard, a former Manhattan Project research scientist, discusses the
				  potential conflict between science and religion, and asserts that they
				  complement rather than contradict each other. Issues surrounding nuclear
				  proliferation, the atom bomb, the church stance on the nuclear arms race,
				  disarmament, arms control, and the effectiveness of fallout shelters
				  predominate. But Pollard also speculates philosophically about the nature of
				  war and warfare, dimensions of reality and existence, and relativity as
				  perceived by physical science and Christianity. See 13/1 and S-40 for a
				  different perspective on nuclear war. </p>

				  recently published the book “God, Allah, and Ju Ju.” Christianity (especially
				  Catholicism), Islam, and indigenous religions (lumped as “Ju Ju”) are compared
				  and contrasted, with regard to their impact on African culture and
				  consciousness. Mendelson asserts that Christianity is a declining force in
				  Africa, while Islam is on the rise – partially due to more effective missionary
				  techniques. So-called “Ju Ju”, according to Mendelson, is crucial to African

				  senator Warren G Magnuson (Democrat) and his opponent Richard Christiansen
				  (Republican) as well as incumbent representative Alfred Westland (Republican)
				  and his opponent Milo E. Moore (Democrat). Magnuson is interviewed for the
				  first ten minutes, and briefly touches upon a range of issues including
				  Medicare, trade, the Kennedy Administration, communism, and his unwillingness
				  to engage his opponent in a televised debate. Christiansen, a former Lutheran
				  Minister, is interviewed for the next ten minutes and focuses primarily on his
				  campaign strategy, although he also takes time to condemn communism. Both
				  interviews touch upon the different political climate in Washington East and
				  West of the Cascades. Westland, of Washington’s Second Congressional District,
				  is interviewed for four minutes, and offers a position on Whatcom County lumber
				  issues. Moore, a former Washington State Fisheries Director, mentions his plan
				  to turn Drayton Harbor and Terrell Creek (Birch Bay) into fish farms. </p>

				  twenty-two minutes. He discusses his reasons for supporting the Cuban
				  revolution against the Baptista government, and why he eventually turned
				  against Castro. He paints a grim picture of living conditions in Cuba, and
				  condemns communism – claiming to have been unaware that that Casto’s rebellion
				  had anything to do with communism. He calls upon the United States to support
				  an insurrection against Castro – two years after the failed Bay of Pigs
				  invasion. The Cuban Missile Crisis and Khrushchev are mentioned frequently.
				  Professor John Wuest of Western Washington State College (later Western
				  Washington University) is interviewed for the balance of the reel, and analyzes
				  the preceding interview. He criticizes Rojas’ call for U.S. support without
				  allowing greater U.S. involvement in a subsequent political restructuring of
				  Cuba. </p>

				  Jewish activist 
				  <persname>Benad Avital</persname>, who was then the Israeli
				  consul to the 13 western states. The London-born Avital discusses a broad range
				  of topics, based upon his varied life experiences. As a filmmaker and film
				  producer in the 1930’s and early 40’s, he worked on the British production of
				  Henry V, starring Laurence Olivier. He also made films in Israel in the mid
				  1950’s. After serving in the RAF signal corps during the second world war,
				  Avital became an active member in AJEX – the Association of Jewish
				  Ex-Servicemen, an anti-fascist protest organization. He describes the tactics
				  used to undermine Sir Oswald Mosley’s British Fascism movement. Next, he
				  discusses life on an Israeli Kibbutz, including the practice of communal
				  child-rearing. He also worked on a cooperative farm. He goes into some detail
				  about his subsequent role as Israeli press officer during the Sinai conflict
				  (the Six Days War), and examines both the causes and results of the war. The
				  ongoing Arab – Israeli tensions, and Middle East turmoil, are at issue. He also
				  comments upon the trial of Adolf Eichmann, and addresses criticism of the
				  kidnapping of the infamous Nazi – often considered to be the architect of the
				  holocaust. </p>

				  famous for his anti-establishment satire, is interviewed in this episode.
				  Although the interviewer (unidentified) calls Gregory America’s “foremost negro
				  comedian,” Gregory comments upon a range of serious topics relating to the
				  civil rights movement. Gregory, who had been shot in the leg during the August
				  1965 Watts Riots in Los Angeles (during which 32 people were killed), discusses
				  segregation, recent civil rights legislation, Martin Luther King, local and
				  regional black leaders, the philosophy of the protest movement, protests,
				  nonviolence, pacifism, and social justice in America. Gregory emphasizes the
				  simmering tensions in oppressed minority communities. This reel also contains
				  two public service announcement commercials. The advertisement preceding the
				  episode is an animation cartoon produced by the American Dental Association,
				  and promotes fluoride and fluoridation as a solution to tooth decay. The ad
				  following the episode, produced by the U.S. Department of Health, Education,
				  and Welfare, promotes clean water – and cites a growing problem of pollution

				  the 1966 attempt by Northwest Aluminum Company to build an Aluminum plant on
				  Guemes Island, one of the San Juan Islands. Although favored by Skagit County
				  and then economically depressed Anacortes, residents of Guemes Island almost
				  uniformly opposed the plan, and formed a citizen’s action group, “Save the San
				  Juans,” led by retired Boeing executive Evan Nelson. Nelson hired a young John
				  Erlichman (pre-Nixon) as the group’s lawyer. Although Skagit County hastily
				  rezoned a portion of the island for heavy industry, in 1967 the corporation
				  bowed to public pressure and withdrew from this attempt. The film features
				  short interviews with people in favor of and opposed to the proposed industrial
				  development (all except Nelson are unidentified). In addition, there is a small
				  amount of scenic footage. See S-53 for more about this issue. See S-36 for

				  begins by discussing the “long hot summer” of race riots which occurred in many
				  U.S. cities that year, and explains why a race riot was unlikely to occur in
				  Washington State. He discusses the social tensions and injustices which led to
				  these outbreaks of chaos and violence, and talks about fair housing
				  legislation. He also mentions, in passing, the similar injustices faced by
				  Native Americans. Next, O’Connell explores the broader topic of soaring crime
				  rates, both nationally and state-wide. He suggests a need to reexamine
				  ineffective punitive measures against crime. Finally, O’Connell calls for major
				  reform of the Washington State Constitution; including a complete
				  constitutional re-write, to be undertaken by a constitutional convention of
				  elected delegates. </p>

				  Immaculate Conception School in Mount Vernon; a second center was located in

				  alienation, and offered bilingual instruction in both English and Spanish.
