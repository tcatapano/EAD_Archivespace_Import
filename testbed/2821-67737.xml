                generation Americans born around the turn of the century. They share their life
                histories, discussing mainly the World War II era, what they lived through,
                what brought them to the United States, and how they adjusted to American life.
                They discuss their native cultures and traditions, as well as their involvement

                <p>The archive of the Center for the Study of History and Memory at Indiana
                    University is open to the use of researchers. Copies of transcript pages are
                    available only when such copies are permitted by the deed of gift signed by the
                    interviewee. Scholars must honor any restrictions the interviewee placed on the
                    use of the interview. Since some of our earlier (pre-computer) transcripts do
                    not exist in final form, any editing marks in a transcript (deletions,
                    additions, corrections) are to be quoted as marked. Tapes may not be copied for
                    patrons unless the deed of gift permits it, and a transcript is unavailable for
                    that interview. The same rules of use that apply to a transcript apply to the
                    taped interview. Interviews may not be reproduced in full for any public use,
                    but excerpted quotes may be used as long as researchers fully cite the data in
                    their research, including accession number, interview date, interviewee's and
                    interviewer's name, and page(s).</p>

                    <p>Ana Asars, born in Latvia on June 30, 1898, discusses the
                        obstacles she overcame throughout her life. She talks about both the German and
                        the Russian occupations of her country and the devastation each brought through
                        communist government, deportation and killing. She recalls fleeing Latvia to
                        refugee camps, where she and others were aided by the International Refugee
                        Organization, and describes that life she lived for over three years. Asars
                        speaks of immigrating to America though sponsorship, of her belief that she
                        would soon return home, and of her impressions of the United States, especially
                        her shock at the lack of women's rights. She also talks about her political
                        involvement in the United States.</p>

                    <p>Roman and Maria Balon, both born in Poland, share their life
                        stories. They talk about the German occupation in Poland and how it turned
                        their lives upside down even before being deported as teenagers to Germany,
                        where they faced many more hardships. They describe the tragedies that they
                        both witnessed and experienced throughout World War II-- the German occupation,
                        concentration camps, refugee camps, etc.-- as well as the hardships of life
                        during that time. The Balons discuss their original hope of returning home to a
                        free Poland after the war, their realization that Russian control was just as
                        dangerous as that of the Germans, and their consequent decision to immigrate to
                        the United States. They discuss the adjustments they had to make creating a new
                        life in America, especially in learning a new language.</p>

                    <p>John Grunwald, born in 1935 in Budapest, Hungary, discusses his
                        early life in Hungary. He talks about the Nazis and what occurred when they
                        came in 1944. He describes his father's escapes as well as his own, and
                        mentions his mother's inability to get out. Grunwald talks of being smuggled
                        into Austria by a professional smuggler paid by an uncle in the United States,
                        then with the aid of the United States International Refugee Organization,
                        finally making it to the United States. Grunwald recalls his education here and
                        his uncle's desire for him to become Americanized. He gives a brief history of
                        the veneer business of his uncle, where Grunwald has worked. He also talks
                        about Hungarian politics during his lifetime as well as his involvement in
                        American politics.</p>

                        August 31, 1898, both in Latvia, discuss the hard life and times that they
                        encountered. They describe fleeing to Germany during the Russian occupation in
                        1944, because there was little other choice. They talk of living in refugee
                        camps and with relatives for five years while Edwins, among other jobs, worked
                        as a translator for the United States Army, before being sponsored to immigrate
                        to the United States. They discuss fleeing to Russia for a time when Germany
                        occupied Latvia, and their hope that after the Russian invasion they would
                        again return to Latvia, which did not come about. They speak of the immigration
                        process, including screening and qualifications. They talk about learning
                        English, and their political involvement in America despite their decision not
                        to become citizens. They also discuss the Latvian immigrant community.</p>

                    <p>Marianna Lukins, born in Latvia on January 1, 1906, discusses
                        the Russian occupation in Latvia and the devastation it caused the country and
                        the people through deportation and seized property. She speaks of the German
                        occupation and why both Germany and Russia would want to overrun Latvia. She
                        recalls the family members she lost to these occupations, including her
                        husband. Lukins fled to Germany with many others in 1944, then to England three
                        years later, where she struggled to make a new life. She explains that she
                        chose to settle in England rather than the United States because she clung to
                        the hope of returning to Latvia and wanted to remain in Europe; this too is why
                        she never sought American citizenship. When her daughters decided to come to
                        America, Marianna came as well to keep the family together. She compares living
                        in the United States with Europe and talks about the Latvian traditions she
                        still practices as well as the now world-wide Latvian community which remains
                        connected.</p>

                    <p>Ruta J. Meijers, born in Latvia on May 12, 1929, recalls both
                        the Russian and the German occupations, and how they affected her as a child ,
                        especially in the area of schooling. She talks about fleeing to Germany and
                        refugee camp life. She discusses the immigration process to the United States,
                        including the screening process and the use of sponsorship. Meijers speaks of
                        Latvian traditions and celebrations, some of which she still upholds, as well
                        as the difficulty she has passing this culture to her children. She discusses
                        her love of Latvia the sadness she feels in being unable to return, and her
                        feeling that although she is an American citizen, she still considers herself
                        Latvian. She talks about her involvement in American politics. She also
                        discusses how she perceives Americans and their treatment of immigrants.</p>

                    <p>Edgars Valdmanis, born in 1925 and his wife, Ivette Valmanis,
                        born in 1930, discuss their early lives in Latvia. They talk about both the
                        German and the Russian occupations of their country and the devastation they
                        caused. They also discuss communism, the practice of deportation, and World War
                        II. They speak of their experiences fleeing Latvia in 1944 to refugee camps in
                        various parts of Europe. The Valdmanises discuss beginning again, first in
                        England, then in the United States and the adjustments they had to make to the
                        new culture and the different language. They share their impressions of America
                        prior to arriving as well as after their arrival. They speak in depth about the
                        world-wide Latvian community- especially in England and America- and they
                        express their desire to preserve their culture. They also talk about their
                        political involvement as American citizens, though they remain Latvian at
                        heart.</p>
