In 1773, Gauld submitted some of his findings to the APS, probably in hopes of having them published in the Transactionsm, and although these were not published, they became one of the first mansucripts entered into the Society's collections. The Gauld manuscript also includes an extract of a letter from John Lorimer to Gauld, 1772, and a sketch of the Middle and Yellow Rivers of West Florida by Thomas Hutchins. When it was received at the APS, it was endorsed: "This long uninteresting Paper can hardly obtain a Place in the Transactions of a Philosophical Society. It should however be preserved in the Files for the Use of Historians or map makers."</abstract>

            <p>The scientific exploration of the North American continent was a major priority of the American Philosophical Society from at least the time of its reorganization in 1769. Surveyors, cartographers, and natural historians carried their work westward, ultimately culminating in the expedition of Lewis and Clark in 1803, but particularly in the years prior to the Revolution, others also sought to explore the southeast. Particularly after the APS began publishing its Transactions in 1771, the Society became a hib of activity for exploration and maping. Bernard Romans, Thomas Hutchins, and John and William Bartram were all members of the Society -- indeed, John Bartram was one of its founders -- and they and others, like William Stork, all submitted the results of their explorations to the APS for discussion, commentary, and dissemination.</p>
            <p>Between 1764 and 1781, the Scots surveyor George Gauld was assigned by the British Admirality to chart the waters of the Gulf Coast off British West Florida, an area that extended from New Orleans to the western coast of modern-day Florida. Viewing his work as a benefit for navigators of all nations, not just Britain, Gauld readily shared his work, including with the APS. He was elected to the Society in 1774. His subsequent history, however, was less happy. In 1776, Gauld was forced to suspend his work in the Dry Tortugas and Florida Keys due to the depredations of American privateers, and he was taken prisoner at the Siege of Pensacola in 1781. Carried off the Havana and then New York, Gauld was repatriated to England, dying shortly thereafter at age 50. He is buried at the chapel in Tottenham Court Road, London.</p>

            <p>George Gauld's manuscript, "A general description of the sea-coasts, harbours, lakes, rivers etc. of the province of West Florida," was the result of a survey completed in 1769, and represents one of the first manuscripts added to the APS Library. In some detail, Gauld's narrative progresses from New Orleans eastward to Florida, commenting on potential ports and any conditions that might affect navigation.</p>
            <p>The manuscript is accompanied by an extract of a letter from Dr. Lorimer to Gauld, August 13, 1772, transmitting a "sketch of the Middle River and Yellow River" from Thomas Hutchins, and discussing both Hutchins and Bernard Romans. The map is included. Upon receipt at the APS, the following comment was appended:</p>
            <p>"This long uninteresting Paper can hardly obtain a Place in the Transactions of a Philosophical Society. It should however be preserved in the Files for the Use of Historians or map makers."</p>

            <p>George Gauld served as a surveyor in the British Army. Stationed in Florida after the Seven Years' War, this collection contains his general observations of the recently acquired territory. Its MOLE entry is very detailed. There are two other general features that should be mentioned. First, Gauld’s essay contains smatterings of references to Native Americans and occasionally local Native American names for geographic features. The second is that this document captures part of the imperial consolidation Great Britain began in the wake of the Seven Years’ War.</p>
