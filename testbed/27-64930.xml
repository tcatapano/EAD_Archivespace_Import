		<head>Biographical Sketch</head> 
		<p>Diego Rivera was born December 8, 1886, in Guanajuato, Mexico. At the
		  age of 10, he began studying art at the San Carlos Academy in Mexico City, in
		  the shop of Félix Parra. In 1907 Rivera received a travel grant and went to
		  Spain to study under Eduardo Chicharro. While in Europe, he traveled to England
		  and Belgium, but he eventually settled in Paris. It was in Paris that Rivera
		  was influenced by Picasso, Braque, Klee, Dérain, Mondrian, and Cézanne. From
		  1909 to 1920 Rivera traveled around Europe with Angelina Beloff, a young
		  Russian painter. Between 1913 and 1917, Rivera made more than 200 Cubist
		  paintings, but after a falling out with Picasso, and a dispute with the critic
		  Pierre Reverdy, he turned away from Cubism, and began to work more in the style
		  of Cézanne.</p> 
		<p>While in Paris, Rivera also met fellow Mexican artist David Alfaro
		  Siqueiros. In 1921, following the Mexican Revolution, Rivera and Siqueiros
		  returned to Mexico. There, together with other artists, including José Clemente
		  Orozco, they formed the Painters' Syndicate, which issued a manifesto promoting
		  public murals with social context. It was during this time that Rivera joined
		  the Mexican Communist Party. In December 1921, Rivera started painting his
		  first major mural for the Bolivar Auditorium of the National Preparatory School
		  in Mexico City. Murals that followed included works for the Ministry of Public
		  Education building in Mexico City, the National School of Agriculture at
		  Chapingo, the Cortés Palace at Cuernavaca, and the National Palace in Mexico
		  City. In 1922, Rivera married Guadalupe Marin, by whom he had two daughters.
		  Their marriage fell apart in 1924, and in August 1929 Rivera married the artist
		  Frida Kahlo.</p> 
		<p>In the early 1930s, Rivera traveled to the United States where he
		  created murals which included works for the New Workers' School in New York
		  City, the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco, the San Francisco Art
		  Institute, City College of San Francisco, and the Detroit Institute of Arts. In
		  1933 Rivera executed 
		<title render="italic">Man at the Crossroads</title> for the Rockefeller
		Center in New York City, but just one year later the Center destroyed this
		mural because one of the figures depicted resembled Vladimir Lenin. (Rivera
		later reproduced this mural at the Palace of Fine Arts, Mexico City.)</p> 
		<p>During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Rivera failed to get more
		  commissions in the United States because he was regarded as being too radical.
		  At this time he also lost favor among the Mexican Communist Party because of
		  his support of Trotsky. In 1947 he painted 
		<title render="italic">Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Almeda Park</title>
		for the Hotel del Prado in Mexico City. His largest mural, a work depicting the
		history of Mexico for the National Palace in Mexico City, was unfinished when
		Rivera died November 25, 1957.</p>
