James Russell Lowell, who was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts on February 22, 1819. An
1838 graduate of Harvard College, Lowell succeeded Henry Wadsworth Longfellow as a
Professor of Modern Languages and Literature at Harvard in 1855. Lowell also served as editor
of the Atlantic Monthly (1857-1862) and the North American Review (1863-1872). He was
American minister to Spain for 3 years (1877-1880) and ambassador to England (1880-1885). In
addition to his teaching and diplomatic service, Lowell was the composer of several sonnets and
hymns. He died on August 12, 1891 and is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. The park, which is located at the end of Brattle Street in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, encompasses 140,000 square feet of land behind the area where James Russell
Lowell's estate once stood. It is held in trust by the Metropolitan District Commission. </p></bioghist><scopecontent><p> These records include copies of the original deed and
correspondence from the park's creation. Also included is some contemporary correspondence
regarding the park. In addition, there are recent color photographs of the park taken by <persname>Gary Koler</persname>, an Arnold Arboretum horticulturalist, and a folder with a
small amount of biographical material on James Russell Lowell. </p><arrangement><p>The
Collection is organized into one alphabetical sequence.</p></arrangement></scopecontent><dsc type="in-depth"><c><did><unitid>1. </unitid><unittitle> Background Information, Lowell Memorial Park, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">ca. 1898</unitdate></unittitle></did></c><c><did><unitid>2. </unitid><unittitle>Biographical Information, James Russell Lowell, </unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1819-1891</unitdate></did></c><c><did><unitid>3. </unitid><unittitle>Correspondence (National Park Service; MA
