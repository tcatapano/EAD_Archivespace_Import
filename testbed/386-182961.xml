		<head>Biographical Sketch of Ralph E. Montonna (1894-1952)</head> 
		<p>Ralph Eugene Montonna was born in Cape Vincent, New York in 1894. He
		  earned his B.S. degree from Syracuse University in 1916 and his Ph.D. from Yale
		  University in 1924. Dr. Montonna joined the faculty at the University of
		  Minnesota in 1924 as an assistant professor of chemical engineering; he was
		  promoted to associate professor 1933 and professor in 1936. In 1945, he was
		  appointed as assistant dean of the graduate school. Dr. Montonna resigned from
		  the University of Minnesota in 1946 to become director of research at Syracuse
		  University. He returned to the University of Minnesota in 1950 to accept the
		  position of director of the engineering experiment station in the University's
		  Institute of Technology. Ralph Montonna died on January 7, 1952. </p>
