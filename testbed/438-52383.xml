Correspondence from New England ministers supports Pearson's desire to elect an orthodox Calvinist as Hollis Professor of Divinity, a narrative written by Pearson defends the selection of a Calvinist as Divinity Professor, and nomination slips and ballots provide evidence of the voting preferences of the Fellows of the Harvard Corporation.  Additional records contain the questions Pearson used to challenge the election of Henry Ware as Hollis Professor of Divinity, extracts taken from the Massachusetts General Court Acts of 1642, 1650, and 1657 and the Harvard Corporation records used in Pearson's research during the selection process, a draft of a broadside focusing on theology, and Henry Ware's course of reading for divinity students at Harvard.

Pearson was an influential figure at Harvard as a professor and a contributor to many Harvard committees.  After the death of Harvard President <persname>Joseph Willard </persname>(1738-1804) in September 1804, Pearson, an <subject>orthodox Calvinist,</subject> assumed the duties as president and soon became embroiled in controversy with other Corporation members regarding the election of <persname>Henry Ware</persname> (1764-1845), a <subject>Unitarian Congregationalist,</subject> as <occupation>Hollis Professor of Divinity.</occupation>  Disenchanted with Harvard's increasingly Unitarianism and the election of Henry Ware as Hollis Professor in 1805, Pearson left Harvard and returned to Andover, Massachusetts, to help establish the<corpname> Andover Theological Seminary</corpname> in 1808.  At the Seminary, Pearson served as professor of sacred theology (1808-1809) and as president of the board of trustees (1802-1821).</p></bioghist><bioghist><head>Historical Note on the election of Henry Ware as Hollis Professor of Divinity  </head><p>After the death of <persname>David Tappan </persname>(1752-1803), the third <occupation>Hollis Professor of Divinity,</occupation> on August 27, 1803, efforts to appoint a replacement by the <corpname>Harvard Corporation</corpname> stalled over the religious beliefs the next Hollis Professor should hold. The Reverend <persname>Henry Ware </persname>(1764-1845), a <subject>Unitarian Congregationalist,</subject> was supported by the laymen members of the Corporation. However, <persname>Eliphalet Pearson</persname> (1752-1826), <occupation>Hancock of Professor of Hebrew and other Oriental Languages,</occupation> argued that the statutes of the Hollis Professorship of Divinity required that the Divinity Professor be a <subject>Calvinist,</subject> and Pearson opposed every candidate proposed that did not meet this religious qualification. Ware's supporters replied that requiring a religious test for a professorial candidate was a "barbarous relic of Inquisitorial power" and contrary to the spirit of the government and people. </p><p>President <persname>Joseph Willard </persname>died on September 25, 1804, before a successor to Tappan could be named. As the senior member on the Harvard faculty, Pearson was appointed acting president and soon after the election process for both the president and Hollis professorship began. Pearson supported the Reverend <persname>Jesse Appleton</persname> (1772-1819), a leader of the conservative element of the <subject>Congregational churches</subject> for the Divinity Professorship. The Corporation was equally divided and spent the month of December 1804 debating the merits of various candidates. On February 1, 1805, a compromise was proposed that would have Ware elected president of Harvard and Appleton as Hollis professor. After several trial ballots, Ware was nominated for the Hollis professorship by a single vote. On February 14, 1805, the <corpname>Board of Overseers</corpname> elected Ware as the new Hollis Professor of Divinity, and thus the oldest theological professorship in the country became Unitarian. The professorship controversy created a divide between Pearson and the liberal members of the Corporation and diminished Pearson's chances to be elected Harvard's next president. On December 11, 1805, the Corporation elected <persname>Fisher Ames</persname> (1758-1808), the Federalist statesman, as president of Harvard. However, citing poor health and old age, Ames declined the appointment. On March 1, 1806, Pearson resigned both his chair and fellowship at Harvard when it became apparent to him that he would not be selected as the next Harvard president. On March 3, 1806, the Corporation elected the Reverend <persname>Samuel Webber</persname> (1759-1810), <occupation>Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy </occupation>and a<subject> Unitarian,</subject> President of Harvard University.</p></bioghist><bioghist><head>Historical Note on the Hollis Professorship of Divinity</head><p>The <subject>Hollis Professorship of Divinity</subject> was founded in 1721 by <persname>Thomas Hollis</persname> (1659-1731), a <geogname>London</geogname><occupation> merchant </occupation>and one of the earliest supporters of <corpname>Harvard College.</corpname> It is the oldest endowed chair in the <geogname>United States</geogname> and the first professorship in<subject> theology</subject> in the country.

The collection contains correspondence from New England ministers supporting Pearson's desire to elect an orthodox Calvinist as Hollis Professor of Divinity, a narrative written by Pearson defending the selection of a theologically "sound and orthodox" individual for Divinity Professor, and nomination slips and ballots which provide evidence of the voting preferences of the Fellows of the Harvard Corporation and also highlight the difficulties in selecting a new professor. In addition, the records contain the questions Pearson presented at a meeting of the Board of Overseers on February 14, 1805 to challenge the election of <persname>Henry Ware</persname> as Hollis Professor of Divinity and extracts, probably used in Pearson's research during the selection process, taken from the Massachusetts General Court Acts of 1642, 1650, and 1657 and Harvard Corporation records pertaining to Harvard College and the Divinity Professorship. Additional records include a draft of a broadside, <title xlink:type="simple">Theses Theologica,</title> focusing on theology, and Ware's course of reading (1808) illustrating the religious instruction given to students of divinity at Harvard at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The records demonstrate Harvard's movement away from orthodox Calvinism to the more liberal theology of Unitarianism and the controversial rejection of Pearson himself as a candidate for the Harvard presidency.
