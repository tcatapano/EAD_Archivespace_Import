            <head>Biographical Sketch
            </head>
            <p>  Lawrence (Larry) Carra was a professor of the Carnegie Mellon University drama department for 31 years, from 1946-1977.  He directed over 350 plays in Texas, Boston, New Jersey, Chicago, and Pittsburgh.  He is also the co-author of the definitive text on directing, <emph altrender="italic">Fundamentals of Play Directing</emph>, which is now in its fifth edition.  At Carnegie Mellon he was appointed the Chairman of the General Committee on Television in 1957 where he worked closely with WQED and KDKA to produced educational programming about theater.  He directed a summer theater program at CMU from 1975-1980.  He produced local music festivals and participated in many different types of drama outreach.  He helped establish the Pittsburgh Music Tent in 1958-1959, and also directed plays for the Civic Light Opera from 1959-1963.  In addition to his stage activities, Carra also worked in television production.
            </p>

            <p>In retirement, Mr. Carra lectured at NYU, UCLA, and USC, while also appearing as a guest director occasionally.  He also served as a consultant for the Ice Capades and Norman Lear Productions.  Carra's former students include William Ball (American Conservatory Theatre, San Francisco), Mel Shapiro (Broadway producer), John Tebelak (author of 'Godspell'), Sada Thompson ('Family'), Jack Klugman ('Quincy' and 'Odd Couple'), and Ken Welch (music and lyrics for 'Roots').

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Lawrence Carra Papers are housed in four archival boxes and arranged into six series.  Series have been designated for biographical information, project files, reference files, stage productions, television and radio productions, and oversized materials.  Generally, these papers include informal and business correspondence, newspaper clippings, playbills, scripts, production notes, and set designs.  The majority of the collection is information about the vast number of stage and television productions directed by Mr. Carra. These subject folders can include playbills, scripts, attendance sheets, rehearsal schedules and other production notes.  The amount of information about each production varies widely.  The collection contains little information about his personal life, aside from brief mentions in scattered correspondence throughout the collection.  There is little information about the operation of the broader Carnegie Mellon University drama department in the collection.

                </unittitle> 
                    <abstract>The biographical information about Lawrence Carra is housed in one folder.  It contains newspaper and magazine articles about his work in Chicago, Texas, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pittsburgh.  Some of the articles are written by him and one article is a transcript of an interview held in 1976.  This folder also contains a published history of the CMU drama department which describes his time as the head of the department.  His obituary from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was added to this file.</abstract>

They contain materials on various activities in which Mr. Carra was active (as a director, lecturer, or consultant) and contain mostly articles, correspondence, and various project reports or playbills.  These activity files span almost 60 years and provide the majority of the documentation of his activities in retirement.  Of particular interest are the materials about his tenure as chairman of the general television committee at CMU in 1957, which provide some insight into the intentions and procedures of CMU's involvement with WQED and KDKA.

                    <abstract>The stage production files account for the majority of the collection and cover 183 plays. These materials are housed in four boxes and arranged alphabetically by the title of the play.  Following the title of the play, the location or group that performed the play is provided to assist researchers interested in particular groups or locations.  For the most repeated locations or companies, an acronym has been assigned.  The list of the acronyms and their meanings is provided above the container listing for this series.  The amount of material in each folder varies widely but most include a playbill and newspaper articles.  Other materials may include scripts, character charts, costume and set designs, correspondence, or other production notes.  A typed script of Carra's thesis "The Great Magician" is included in folder 47. </abstract>

                    <abstract>The television and radio production files are housed in one box and arranged alphabetically by the title of the production.  The materials in this series are similar to those in the stage productions series including scripts, newspaper articles, correspondence, and production notes.  There are two folders worth of information about the Pulitzer Playhouse series in this series as well as a script for the television adaptation of Carra's own "The Great Magician."  Some materials were more difficult to date than the stage production files due to the lack of a playbill or other dated material for a television production. </abstract>
