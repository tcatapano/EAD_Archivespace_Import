	 <head>Biographical Note</head><p>Geologist Jesse James (J. J.) Galloway was
		born in Noble County, Indiana on August 23, 1882. After completing his
		doctorate in geology at Indiana University, Galloway became a leader in his
		field for his penetrating studies of Bryozoa, Foraminifera and
		Stromatoporoidea. By the time of his retirement from teaching in 1954, Galloway
		was Geologist and Research Director of Paleontology and Stratigraphy for the
		Indiana Department of Conservation. He was also a student, collaborator and
		life-long friend of Dr. E. R. Cumings. Galloway died of a heart attack in his
		home in Bloomington, Indiana on April 10, 1962.</p>

	 <head>Scope and Contents</head> 
	 <p>The report by geologist J. J. Galloway is concerned with the geology of
		Southern Mexico and the possibility of finding and harvesting oil from that
		region. The report is based on a field examination of about two months in the
		summer of 1924 in the company of T. W. Callahan, a study of rocks and fossils
		from Southern Mexico, and cuttings from La Cruzada. It is supplementary to a
		report by Callahan and references the maps and sections of that document. At
		the time of the report’s writing, Galloway was a Professor of Geology at
		Indiana University.</p>
