			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Born in Denton County, Texas, Samuel Lawton “Sam” Martin (1901-1961) married Cecil
				Cleo Cross. He received a B.S. in industrial education from North Texas State
				Teachers College (now the University of North Texas) in 1926 and an M.S. in
				industrial education from Texas A  M University in 1932. Martin taught
				architectural and mechanical drawing in Austin Public Schools from 1922 until he
				became principal of the Austin Public Evening School and Supervisor of Industrial
				and Vocational Education for Austin Public Schools in 1939. During his tenure,
				Martin expanded the evening school program to help adults earn high school diplomas
				and prepare for college. He also received the Texas Trades and Industries Service
				Award (1951), the Austin Building Trades Council Award (1960), and the U.S.
				Department of Labor’s Certificate of Meritorious Service (1960). In 1968, Austin
				named Sam L. Martin Middle School in his honor. </p>
