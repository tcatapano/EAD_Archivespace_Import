         <p>James W. Throckmorton, born in Tennessee in 1825, moved to Texas in 1841. He studied medicine and served in the Mexican War as an army surgeon. After discharge from the army, he married Annie Rattan in 1848 and settled near McKinney in Collin County. In 1851, he entered politics and was elected to the Texas Legislature where he served as either a state representative or senator for the next ten years. A member of the Secession Convention in 1861, he was one of the seven delegates to vote against secession. Despite his vote, Throckmorton served in the Confederate army, eventually becoming a brigadier general. After the war, he served as president of the Constitutional Convention of 1866. He ran for governor of Texas in 1866 and was elected, defeating E. M. Pease. In July 1867, Throckmorton was removed from office by General Philip Sheridan as <emph render="doublequote">an impediment to reconstruction.</emph> Throckmorton continued in politics and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, holding that office from 1874 until 1888. He ran unsuccessfully for governor twice, in 1878 and 1890, before he died in 1894.</p>
