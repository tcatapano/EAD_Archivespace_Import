                <emph render="italic">About Edmund Booth</emph></p>
            <p>Edmund Booth was born August 24, 1810. At age five, he lost partial sight and his hearing from illness. He attended the Connecticut School for the Deaf, eventually teaching at the school for five years. From there he travelled to Iowa and helped found the town of Anamosa. Booth left Iowa to seek fortune in the California Gold Rush in 1849. In 1854 he returned to Anamosa and bought the local newspaper, 
                <emph render="italic">The Anamosa Eureka</emph>. Not only did Booth own the paper, he served as writer and editor as well.</p>
            <p>Booth was also a passionate advocate for educating deaf children, and he was heavily influential in the establishment of the Iowa State School for the Deaf and the National Association of the Deaf. Edmund Booth died in Anamosa, Iowa in 1905.</p>
