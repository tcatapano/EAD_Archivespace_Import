Dorchester, Mass. on Nov. 12, 1795, the son of a minister who had for a short time been 
Librarian of Harvard. Harris attended Harvard, receiving his A.B. degree in 1815 and his M.D. in 
1820. He practiced medicine for a while but was not able to make a comfortable living at it. He 
married <persname>Catherine Holbrook,</persname> the daughter of his first medical partner, 
and from 1826-1849 they had twelve children, one of whom died in infancy.</p><p>Having 
looked around for a better way to support himself and his family, Harris took the position of <occupation>Librarian </occupation>of Harvard in <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1831,</date> after the death of 
Benjamin Peirce. Over the years, Harris had developed a private interest in natural history, 
particularly in entomology, an interest that was originally sparked by contact with William 
Dandridge Peck. In 1831 he prepared a catalogue of insects for Edward Hitchcock's Report on 
the Geology, Minerology, Botany and Zoology of Massachusetts. From 1837-1842 he gave 
lectures on natural history at Harvard, during thevacancy of the natural history professorship. 
During those years he also taught a private class on entomology and prepared "A Report on the 
Insects of Massachusetts, injurious to vegetation." He built up a carefully described and arranged 
insect collection, compiled painstaking indexes to major works on entomology, and over the 
course of his life published on the order of a hundred articles on insects and insect-related 
diseases. He had hoped to be appointed professor of natural history, but that position wentto Asa 
Gray in 1842.</p><p>Harris was interested in botany as well as entomology, but his botanical 
achievements never reached the level of his entomological ones. He published three articles on 
squashes and pumpkins in New England Farmer, 1851-1852, and left a manuscript of "an 
elaborate monograph of the natural order Cucurbitaceae" (according to Higginson). After Asa 
Gray's appointment, Harris had less and less time available for natural history study, a source of 
continual frustration to him. When he died on Jan. 16, 1856, he still held the post of Librarian of 
Harvard.</p><p>References:</p><p>Barnhart, John Hendley. <title xlink:type="simple">Biographical Notes upon
