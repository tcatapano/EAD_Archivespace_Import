    <bioghist>
      <p>After being founded as the Superior Fire Underwriters' Association (1901-1908), the Superior, Wisconsin Board of Underwriters incorporated on June 11, 1908 with the stated purpose of joining local fire and casualty insurance agents in an organization to establish and maintain adequate and equitable rates of fire insurance. Each insurance agent was required to represent at least two stock companies and to pledge all his insurance brokerage business with Board members. Four constitutional officers and a Board of Directors presided over the business of the Board. Committees were appointed on membership, finance, arbitration and improvement, fire protection, and legislation. The position of solicitor was instituted to be responsible for renewals and the collection of premiums. Except for correspondence there are no records for the Board after 1930. The Board, apparently, dissolved in 1933.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <p>The Records consist of constitutions, by-laws, and resolutions; proceedings; financial records; correspondence; and miscellaneous administrative papers directly concerning the Board of Underwriters. The materials have been arranged by type of record and chronologically thereunder.</p>
      <p>The Proceedings file includes the minutes of the meetings of the Superior Fire Underwriters Association, ugust 13, 1900-May 11, 1908, and its successor, the Superior Board of Underwriters, July 14, 1908-April 25, 1919. Also included are minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors, August 14, 1916-January 27, 1933, much of which is handwritten in rough note form.</p>
      <p>Filed with the Financial Records of the Board are statements and invoices, 1913-1926, which include some correspondence, in particular relating to notification by various insurance companies of grain lines open in 1915. There is also a Treasurer's Cash Book, 1901-1916, recording cash transactions of the Board with date of payment, payor and assessment of payee and purpose, voucher number, and amount. The back of the volume contains a membership fee account, 1908-1909, and a special account, 1908-1916, kept by B. S. Loney, Trustee. Also in this file are bank deposit books, 1913-1926; check stub books, 1914-1926; and (stock?) certificate stub books, 1908-1909.</p>
      <p>The Correspondence file consists of correspondence of the Superior Fire Underwriters' Association, 1901-1908, and the Superior Board of Underwriters, 1908-1933 (primarily 1908-1919), concerning policy, proxies, financial matters, and legislative information and queries. Also included are commentaries on resolutions and circular letters. Much of the material in this file deals with the activities of Robert B. Nye, and the ouster proceedings of Charles A. Erhart in 1918.</p>
