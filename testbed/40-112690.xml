            <p>The earliest papers consist of letters (Jan. 1929) Josephine Downey sent to her
                family while teaching high school in Nemo, South Dakota. The letters describe
                Downey's living arrangements and social life, her school work and students, and her
                decision to attend graduate school and not return the following year.</p>
            <p>A diary (June 9-Aug. 25, 1931) and group of letters (June 13-Aug. 22, 1931) provide
                an account of Downey's first European tour, beginning with her train trip to New
                York City and voyage on board the S.S. St. Louis (June 12-22). Downey and her
                traveling companion, Helen, disembarked at Hamburg, proceeded to Sweden where they
                visited relatives (June 25-July 3), and traveled across Norway (July 4-6). After
                completing the Scandinavian leg of their journey, the two women sailed to England
                and met the Carleton Tour in Glasgow, Scotland. The tour's itinerary included visits
                to Scotland and England (July 7-16), Paris (July 17-21), Belgium and Holland (July
                22-23), Germany (July 24-30), Czechoslovakia (July 31-Aug. 1), Hungary (Aug. 2),
                Austria (Aug. 3-5), Switzerland (Aug.6-12), and Italy (Aug. 13-25). Downey's account
                of the tour includes descriptions of the countryside, sightseeing and shopping, the
                weather, and their hotels and meals. Lists of the tour's hotels and the ships the
                women sailed on is included at the end.</p>
            <p>Another diary, which is accompanied by a partial itinerary, documents another of
                Downey's European tours (June 23-Aug. 29, 1936). This trip included an extended stay
                in Paris where Downey attended school (July 7-Aug. 14). The account begins with a
                description of the train trip to New York City and voyage on board the Lafayette
                (June 27-July 6). Entries made during Downey's stay in Paris describe her living
                arrangements and social life; plays she attended; sightseeing in Paris and vicinity,
                including a brief trip to London (Aug. 1-4); the weather; and her school work. After
                completing school Downey made a tour of Normandy (Aug. 15-19), visited Lucerne and
                Interlaken, Switzerland (Aug. 20-22), and Florence, Italy (Aug. 23-26). The last
                entries describe Downey's last night in Paris and her return voyage on board the
                S.S. Paris.</p>
            <p>A third diary describes an automobile trip to Mexico that Downey made with two
                friends (June 18-Aug. 1, 1939). The account begins with a description of a week-long
                religious institute the women attended in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin (June 18-24). The
                entries describe the trip south to Mexico City including stops in Monterrey, Ciudad,
                and Iacala (June 25-30); an extended stay in Mexico City (July 1-July 12); trips to
                Taxco (July 13-17) and Oaxaca (July 21-25); and the road trip back to St. Paul (July
                28-Aug. 1). Downey provides detailed accounts of the food and hotels, a bull fight
                they attended (July 2), sightseeing excursions which included visits to a number of
                ruins and shrines, shopping days at different markets, various dances and ceremonies
                they witnessed, a cockfight (July 23), and the difficulties they experienced during
                customs inspection on their way back to the U.S. (July 29).</p>
            <p>The remainder of the collection consists primarily of letters Downey sent her family
                while serving as a cryptographer with the Women's Army Corps during World War II.
                Downey joined the service in October 1943 and completed her basic training at Fort
                Oglethorpe, Georgia. The early letters (undated and Jan. 1943-Mar. 1944) discuss her
                experiences as a general clerk at Fort Hamilton, NewYork. She was next sent for
                decoding training at the Missouri Signal Corp School at Camp Crowder, Missouri. She 
                departed for San Francisco (Aug. 9, 1944) where she waited until shipping out for
                New Guinea (Aug. 20, 1944).</p>
            <p>Downey arrived in New Guinea at "Base B" at the beginning of September 1944 and was
                later transferred to a base at Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea (Jan. 1945). Her letters
                from New Guinea describe camp conditions; problems with the mail and personal items
                she requested her family to send; her job; her social life, including the men she
                dated; recreational activities; the weather; boredom due to the safety restrictions
                placed on the women at "Base B" and the lifting of those restrictions after moving
                to Hollandia; frustration over her lack of promotion; and her good conduct medal
                (March 1, 1945).</p>
            <p>Downey was transferred to Manila (April 1945) and remained there until she accepted
                an assignment in Shanghai, China (Jan. 1946?). The letters during this period
                describe her living quarters; recreational activities; her job; her experiences with
                the Filipino people and views on U.S. relations with the Philippines; Filipino
                accounts of their treatment under the Japanese; classes she attended on Philippine
                history and Tagalog at the Philippine University; her attendance at the trial of
                General Tomoyuki Yamashita and the witnesses' accounts of Japanese atrocities (Nov.
                1945); and her post-war plans.</p>
            <p>Downey's final letters from Manila (Jan. 1946) discuss her decision to accept an
                assignment in China and the boredom she faced while being restricted to a staging
                area prior to her departure. Downey's last letter (April 27, 1946), written during
                her service as a cryptographic technician with the American Consul in Shanghai,
                describes a Chinese opera she attended and relates her decision to return to the
                U.S. rather than stay in China through October 1946.</p>
            <p>Other papers related to Downey's military service include her enlistment and
                discharge records (1943, 1946), her campaign ribbons, and a number of photographs
                taken during her assignments in New York, New Guinea, and Manila.</p>
            <p>A final group of papers contains writings by Downey including a term paper she wrote
                based on a visit to Guatemala during the Summer of 1947, an article she submitted
                for publication (July 1947) entitled "Life in a Leaky Tent or How WACS Became
                Rugged," and a poem entitled "WAC On New Guinea."</p>
