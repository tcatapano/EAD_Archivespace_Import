Between 2001 and 2006, they traveled across the United States asking groups of women to respond to the question: What do you wear that makes you feel powerful?  They talked with more than 500 women and girls, from age four to ninety-two, and from a wide range of backgrounds.  What emerged was a wider dialogue about the expectations and limitations placed upon them by their affiliation with a specific gender, culture, race, class, or profession.  The result was a project called Trappings: Stories of Women, Power and Clothing.  The project included the interviews, exhibitions around the country, a book, and a web site.</p></bioghist><scopecontent><head>SCOPE AND CONTENT</head><p>The collection consists of postcards, posters, and other publicity and printed material about Trappings.</p></scopecontent><dsc type="in-depth"><head>INVENTORY</head><c level="item"><did><unitid>1.1.</unitid><unittitle>Contents: Postcard
