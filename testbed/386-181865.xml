		<head>Processing Information</head> 
		<p>The collection was processed and finding aid written in 2010 by Ann
		  Mulfort, with the support of student assistants, Sarah Marrone and Kerry
		  Ritterbusch.</p> 
		<p>To maintain Robert Bly's original order of usage of the documents, his
		  file contents and titles were retained, where possible. Therefore, if the
		  contents of one file include materials from multiple series, they are located
		  with Bly's original organization of the materials. For example, the file
		  entitled: "Don Hall's comments on 'Light Around the Body'" is found in the
		  Poetry manuscripts series, because it includes revisions to his poetry, but
		  also includes some correspondence from Hall which provides context for the
		  revisions.</p>

	 <arrangement encodinganalog="351"> 
		<head>Arrangement</head> 
		<p>Robert Bly's career includes many vocations, and the series
		  designations reflect this diversity. Because of his varied career, there is
		  much crossover in the materials of this collection. Researchers are encouraged
		  to review the descriptions of each series carefully.</p> 
		<p>The files are organized based on what is contained in the majority of
		  the materials for each file. For instance, when most of the items in a
		  particular file contain translated poetry and prose, they are located in the
		  Translations series. When most of the items in a file embody publishing and
		  editing work in translation, they are located in the Publishing and Editing
		  series. Therefore, to study poetry translations as a publishing business
		  venture, researchers are encouraged to review both series.</p> 
		<p>The collection is organized into eighteen series. Because of the
		  extent of information in the collection, each series is described in a separate
		  finding aid. Please click on the desired series below for a full description of
		  materials contained in it.</p>

		<head>Scope and Content Note</head> 
		<p>This series includes both loose positive and negative photographs and
		  slides in black and white and color. In addition, photograph albums beginning
		  with Robert Bly's parents, Jacob and Alice (Aws) Blys' collections from the
		  1900s through Robert Bly's childhood to adult photographs of Bly in 2007 are
		  found in this series. Many family photographs, including the Bly family trip to
		  the Black Hills of South Dakota and Mount Rushmore (under construction) in
		  1937, as well as the wedding photograph of Robert and Carol Bly in 1955 are
		  contained in the series.</p> 
		<p>The series is arranged in two subseries to reflect the manner in which
		  the photographs were received in the Archives. Loose photographs were
		  discovered throughout the collection, and separate photograph albums were also
		  received. The photographs in the albums were removed for separate storage, and
		  the albums were retained in the Personal series.</p> 
		<p>Strict chronology is not found in this series, as many of the
		  photographs were received without dates or other documentation. In addition,
		  the photograph albums were not necessarily created in chronological order.</p>
