             <abstract label="Abstract">This personal album illustrates the sights and peoples experienced by the voyagers of the Corwin. There are many views of Inuit villages and inhabitants in Alaska and coastal Siberia, along with scenery and seascapes. All photographs are accompanied by detailed, manuscript captions in ink by an unknown individual. Photographs depict Alaskan nature scenes and harbors; Inuit people, dwellings and villages; and documentation of the fur trade in the nineteenth century. This collection primarily provides insight into the USRC “Thomas Corwin’s Arctic voyage in 1881. It is unclear if the photographs taken in 1883 are of a later voyage.
The collection is particularly strong in images of fur trade expeditions and merchants, and Inuit people and dwellings.</abstract>

        <bioghist id="bioghist"><head>Biography/Administrative History</head><p>Individual related to this collection: Michael A. Healy, 1839-1904,(not depicted in this collection) served with the Thomas Corwin beginning in 1882; he rose to the position of captain in March of 1883. While in command of the Corwin, Healy patrolled the Arctic to prevent illegal sale of guns and alcohol to the Alaskan natives and to control illegal fur seal hunting. The captain was also concerned for the well-being of the Alaskan natives, and ferried Siberian caribou over to help reestablish the natives’ food supply since many seals and walruses were killed by white traders. </p></bioghist>
        
        <scopecontent id="scopecontent"><head>Scope and Content of Collection</head><p>The photographs of the Inuit inhabitants include portraits; views of homes and villages; and the killing and skinning of seals. There are also views of non-Indian hunters and traders.  The Inuit villages and dwellings illustrated are in Sitka, St. Michael, Kings Island, and locations in Siberia. There is one view of an Eskimo [i.e. Inuit] grave at an unidentified location. The photograph album has the words Scenes in Alaska and the Arctic Ocean. 1883 embossed on the cover.  An ink manuscript title page reads: Cruise of the Revenue Cutter Corwin 1881.
