The Records of land and property owned by Harvard University contain records related to the land and property owned and managed by Harvard between 1643 and 1835 and include legal documents, leases and memoranda, surveyors' plans and appraisals of many of the properties, correspondence, bills, and other materials.

These properties extended across New England, in what is now Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine, and  also included revenue generated from the lease of an estate in England.  Records include correspondence; leases, bonds,  deeds, wills, and other legal documents; surveyors' plans and assessments of various lands; bills; statements of account; and memoranda.   The records provide insight into land  settlement in colonial New England; the challenges of marking boundaries and establishing legal ownership of land; economic difficulties in the colonies; and the legal, interpersonal, and financial challenges of managing extensive property holdings. Many of the records were created by these Harvard Treasurers: Thomas Danforth, Thomas Brattle, John White, Edward Hutchinson, Thomas Hubbard, John Hancock, Ebenezer Storer, Jonathan Jackson, John Davis, Ebenezer Francis, and Thomas Wren Ward.</p><p>It should be noted that some documents whose dates are between January 1 and March 25 in the years prior to 1752 have been cited with the double date convention, e.g.  February 27, 1658/9.  This convention  has been followed only when the document itself indicates the date in such a manner. This convention was used in England and the North American colonies between 1582 and 1752. The first date refers to the year according to the Julian calendar, which began on March 25, while the second refers to the year according to the Gregorian calendar, which began on January 1. </p></scopecontent><dsc type="in-depth"><head>Series descriptions and folder list     </head><c id="tarSeriesI" level="series"><did><unittitle>I.

Rogers had served as minister of the Church at Rowley in Yorkshire (England)  for almost two decades, but he was  suspended from his duties there in 1638 because of increasing disagreement with the Church of England over religious doctrine.  Rogers decided to flee to New England and, convincing twenty-two families among his congregation to accompany him, set sail on board the ship <title xlink:type="simple">John of London</title> in 1638.  Also on board  was the first printing press to arrive in America with several fonts of type, brought by the Reverend Joseph Glover (who died on the journey) and the printer Stephen Daye, accompanied by his sons, Stephen, Jr. and Matthew. The vessel arrived in Salem in December of 1638, and Rogers and his followers likely spent that winter in Salem.  By the spring of 1639, they had settled in the town they would name Rowley (after the English village they had left behind); the town was incorporated on September 4, 1639.  Rogers served as pastor there until his death on January 23, 1661.</p><p>In his will, Rogers specified that "all [his] houses, barn, and orchard, and all [his] lands, pastures and commonages and meadows" (approximately 26 parcels of land,  and  196 acres in total)  should be given to the town and church of Rowley following his wife Mary's death, but with a requirement that would prove significant: the land would only belong to the town and church on the condition that neither of the two teaching elders' positions should remain vacant for  longer than four years.   Rogers specified that, should those posts remain vacant for more than four years, all the lands he had bequeathed should "be [instead given] to the use of Harvard College, at Cambridge, in New England."  He also gave Harvard "all [his] Latin books [...] and some English books."  By 1700, the church had allowed the elders' positions to remain vacant for too long, and the land was reverted to Harvard.  Various legal investigations and agreements ensued, including a 1704 decision to lease the land, and a 1734 decision to sell the land off in lots.  The College began to sell their portion of Rogers' property in 1735, and many Rowley inhabitants - including Nathaniel Bradstreet, Thomas Lambert, and Daniel Hale     - were among the purchasers.  By 1764 all of the land in Rowley belonging to Harvard had been sold.</p></bioghist><bibliography><head>References</head><list><item>Gage, Thomas. <title xlink:type="simple">The History of Rowley, Anciently Including Bradford, Boxford, and Georgetown.</title> Boston: Ferdinand Andrews, 1840.</item><item>Jewett, Amos Everett and Emily Mabel Adams Jewett.  <title xlink:type="simple">Rowley, Massachusetts, ‘Mr. Ezechi Rogers Plantation,’ 1639-1850.</title> Rowley: The Jewett Family of America, 1946. </item></list></bibliography><scopecontent><p>This series contains records related to the land and property in Rowley bequeathed to Harvard by Ezekiel Rogers, including documents created in the course of several legal disputes over ownership of the land and/or the right to access it.

Although the rental income would fluctuate from year to year and it was not always possible to find descendants of Pennoyer or scholars from New Haven to fund, Pennoyer's bequest provided scholarships for numerous Harvard students for over two centuries.  By 1740, the original trustees of Pennoyer's estate had died, and from that year until the farm was sold in 1903 the Governors of Christ's Hospital in England found tenants for the farm, collected rent, and managed the property.  A Harvard liaison in England then submitted the  appropriate revenues to Harvard.  By the late nineteenth century the farm had become unprofitable, largely because of an  agricultural depression, and in 1897 the Harvard Corporation decided to sell it.  Following several years of administrative challenges, the farm was sold in April 1903 for $4,029.52, which was added to the Pennoyer fund still maintained by Harvard.</p></bioghist><bibliography><head>References</head><list><item>Morison, Samuel Eliot.

Hayward bequeathed the land to Harvard in 1672, and the College leased it out for almost a century (although the earliest known lease was created in 1735, it was possibly leased in earlier years).   A December 1828 vote authorized its sale, which presumably took place soon after.  Included in this series are an extract from John Hayward's will; leases of the pasture to numerous individuals, including Joseph Coolidge, John Hastings, Isaac Sanderson, Richard Lechmere, Jonathan Bird, and Samuel Bird; legal agreements related to the land; accounts of work done and the valuation of treetops cut and taken from the land; a deed of sale  for 3½ acres of land adjacent to Hayward’s Pasture, and other documents. </p></scopecontent><c><did><unittitle>Manuscript copy of a clause from John Hayward’s will, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">July 31, 1672</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 1, Folder 91</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Statement of the boundaries of Hayward’s Pasture, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Sept. 22, 1732</unitdate> and <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">April 30, 1735</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 1, Folder 92</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Verso mistakenly records the date as Sept. 1752.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Lease of Hayward’s Pasture to Joseph Coolidge and John Hastings, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">March 25, 1735</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 1, Folder 93</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Rent was 50 shillings the first year, and 5 pounds each of the following four years (5-year rent).

The island is approximately 62 acres in size, with half of the land considered "upland" and the other half "intertidal."  It was once used by Native Americans, and after it was bequeathed to Harvard College by Samuel Ward in 1680 it was leased to tenant farmers.  In the early nineteenth century, it was host to a fish-drying operation, and in the early twentieth century it housed a fish smelting operation. In 1900, Boston philanthropist Albert Burrage leased the island from Harvard and constructed  a hospital for children with physical disabilities; the hospital burned in 1945. During the second world war Burrage also allowed the United States Navy to use the island as a training station.  It was purchased by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the 1980s and  is now part of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area.</p></bioghist><scopecontent><p>	Samuel Ward, a resident of Charlestown, Massachusetts, bequeathed the island to Harvard College in 1680.  He had either purchased it from the town of Weymouth or been granted it by the British Crown (sources differ), and he gave it to Harvard with the intention of providing a source of income from tenant farmers that would benefit Harvard students.  Ward's will reads as follows:    "I give the island living betwixt Hingham  Hull called Bumpkin Island unto the Colledge and my mind that it be called by the name of Ward's Island."  He made this gift "for the easement of the charges of the dyet of the students that are in Commons."  This series contains Ward's deed of gift for the island and an extract from his will; leases of the island to tenants including Isaac Lobdell, Joseph Lobdell, Cromwell Lobdell, Solomon Lovell, Benjamin Lincoln, Martin Lincoln, Abner Lincoln, Daniel Spear, Josiah Adams, Josiah Davis(?), and Elijah Spear; and correspondence related to the property and its management.</p></scopecontent><c><did><unittitle>Deed of gift from Samuel Ward to Harvard College for Ward’s Island, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">April 9, 1680</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 8, Folder 7</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Signed by Samuel Ward, Thomas Danforth, and Thomas Barnard.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Extract from Samuel Ward’s will giving Ward’s Island to Harvard College, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">March 6, 1681</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 2, Folder 11</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Lease of Ward’s Island to Isaac Lobdell, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1696</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 11, Folder 1</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Lease of Ward’s Island to Joseph Lobdell, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">March 1, 1707/8</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 11, Folder 2</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Joseph Lobdell’s agreement to lease Ward’s Island for one year, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">March 11, 1728</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 11, Folder 3</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Lease of Ward’s Island to Joseph Lobdell, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Oct. 1, 1729</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 11, Folder 4</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Signed by John Corssen and Owen Harris.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Plan of Ward’s Island “survey’d by Mr. Thaxter of Hingham [and] plotted by Mr. Danforth of Cambridge,” <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1729</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 8, Folder 8</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Lease of Ward’s Island to Joseph Lobdell, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">March 1, 1731</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 11, Folder 5</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Lease of Ward’s Island to Joseph Lobdell, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">May 16, 1732/3</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 11, Folder 6</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Signed by Joseph Lobdell, Thos.

As a result, between 1691 and the establishment of Maine's statehood in 1820, the expansive lands of Maine belonged to Massachusetts.  Although frequently interrupted by war and unrest, the Maine lands (often referred to as "Eastern lands") slowly began to be settled in the early eighteenth century.  In the years following the American Revolution, settlement in Maine increased as leaders of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts realized the potential economic boon of selling off parcels of land in Maine to generate revenue and help pay off war debt.</p><p>In 1783, the Commonwealth owned 17 million acres of Maine land.  Numerous sales committees were formed in the following decades, and as early as 1786 approximately 100,000 acres of Maine land had been sold, primarily in small parcels of 150 acres and 500 acres.  In order to increase sales, a land lottery was established, allowing interested buyers to purchase tickets which guaranteed a parcel of land, though its quality and location were left to chance.  The lottery drawing, held in 1787, was less successful than had been hoped, though.    Sales of Maine land continued into the nineteenth century, with agents specializing in the task and an increased focus on the persecution of squatters and timber thieves. </p><p>Squatters were the problem which most plagued those responsible for the Maine lands.  Given the distance from Massachusetts, it was a great challenge to monitor the illegal settlement of the lots, and on many occasions squatters not only built homes and barns on the lands, but also removed timber and sold it, greatly reducing the land's value.  The prevention of timber theft was increasingly a concern from the 1790s onward.</p></bioghist><bibliography><head>References</head><list><item><ref xlink:href="http://www.sec.state.ma.us/arc/arcpdf/eastland.pdf" xlink:type="simple">Eastern Lands Papers finding aid, Massachusetts Archives.</ref></item><item>Williamson, William D.   <title xlink:type="simple">The History of the State of Maine.</title> Hallowell, Maine: Glazier, Masters  Co., 1832.</item></list></bibliography><scopecontent><p>This series contains records related to Maine lands belonging to Harvard; it is divided into twelve subseries, according to geographic location or subject matter.

Correspondence in these records is often about boundary surveys; the sale of the lots; the value of the land per acre; trespassers and disputes regarding ownership; and the quality of the soil, timber, and stones on the lots. </p></scopecontent><c id="tarSeriesVIIa" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>A. Merriconeag Neck, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1690-1729</unitdate></unittitle></did><scopecontent><p>Samuel Sewall and his wife, Hannah Hull Sewall, attempted to give a 1,000 acre tract of land in Maine called Merriconeag Neck to Harvard in the 1690s; their intented gift proved unsuccessful, though, and the land never came into Harvard's possession.  This land was initially granted to John and Elizabeth Endicott on May 6, 1657.  At that time, the Massachusetts General Court granted the Endicotts  1,000 acres, in a location of their choosing (which they did not specify).  In 1658, John Hull - Hannah Hull Sewall’s father - purchased the grant of land from the Endicotts and requested that it be laid out at Merriconeag Neck, Maine.  The Court agreed to this, and the land was later inherited by Hannah who, along with her husband, gave the land to Harvard.</p><p>Merriconeag Neck had gone  unsurveyed for many years, though, because of the upheaval in Maine caused by the French and Indian Wars. Since it had not been surveyed, the land was not considered  to be legally in the possession of the Sewalls, or later of Harvard.    In November 1731, the Harvard College Overseers recommended taking legal action to secure the lands, and the Corporation initiated a lawsuit that would extend into 1733, when the Court decided against the College.  Harvard not only lost the Merriconeag Neck lands, but also faced significant legal expenses as a result.</p><p>It should be noted that most of the records related to Merriconeag Neck are severely mold-damaged and in need of conservation.   Their contents have not yet been determined and they are  not listed in this finding aid.  The records listed here consist of deed of sale for additional land to Samuel Sewall (presumably also part of the later Sewall gift, though this is currently not certain), a General Court grant, a map, and a surveyor's plot of the land.</p></scopecontent><c><did><unittitle>Deed of sale for 500 acres on Merriconeag Neck (Maine), from Joshua Scotton and Lydia Scotton to Samuel Sewall, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">March 29, 1690 </unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 9, Folder 2</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>This lot of 500 acres had been granted to Joshua Scotton by the Massachusetts General Court in 1684; he then had it laid out by Edward Tyng and Dominicus Jordan, before selling it to Samuel Sewall.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Grant of 1,000 acres on Merriconeag Neck (Maine), issued by Massachusetts General Court to Samuel Sewall and Hannah Sewall, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Nov. 8, 1693 </unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Oversize cabinet, Folder 1</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Signed by William Phips and Isaiah Addington, Secretary of the General Court.

He bequeathed multiple lots there to Harvard, stipulating that rental income from the tenants to whom he had awarded very long leases (999 years) should be paid to the College after his death.  By providing such long leases at a low cost, Danforth encouraged settlement in Framingham.  Although he died in 1699, it appears to have taken some time for Harvard to have received any financial benefit from his bequest.     Tenants John Whitney and Moses Haven were informed by 1726 that they should thenceforward pay their rents to the Harvard Treasurer.  Later tenants included Isaac Bowin and Benjamin Whitney, who would eventually transfer their leases to Daniel Haven.  Harvard eventually sold the lots,   to Moses Haven and Daniel Haven in 1767, and to  Nathaniel Biglow at an unknown date.

This farm constituted a portion of a larger tract of land in Narragansett country purchased by John Hull (Hannah's father) and others in 1657, in what was called the Petaquamscot purchase.  Harvard leased the Narragansett farm to a series of tenant farmers, including Stephen Gardner, Paske Austin, Peter Reynolds, Peter Reynolds, Jr., Palmer Cleaveland, Nicholas Gardner, and Huling Gardiner.  On January 4, 1809, an auction was held in which rights to remove the timber from individual portions of the farm    were sold.  On June 23, 1827, another auction was held, and the lots themselves were sold, ending Harvard's involvement with the land.</p></bioghist><bibliography><head>References</head><list><item>Quincy, Josiah.  <title xlink:type="simple">The History of Harvard University.</title> Cambridge, Mass.: John Owen, 1840.</item><item>Bicknell, Thomas Williams.  <title xlink:type="simple">The History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.</title> New York: The American Historical Society, 1920.</item></list></bibliography><scopecontent><p>This series contains records related to the Narragansett farm owned by Harvard.  It includes the original deed of gift for the farm, as well as abundant correspondence with and about the farm's tenants,  Stephen Gardner, Paske Austin, Peter Reynolds, Peter Reynolds, Jr., Palmer Cleaveland, Nicholas Gardner, and Huling Gardiner.  It should be noted that there are variations in the spelling of several of these men's names, including Reynolds/Raynolds and Gardner/Gardiner.   The farm was divided into smaller tracts of land, and thus often occupied by several tenants at once.  This series also includes correspondence with local agents (most often lawyers) whom Harvard hired to manage the farm's affairs.  These agents were Francis Willett, Joseph Denison, Rouse J. Helm, David Leonard Barnes, and Thomas Burgess, and their correspondence with the College Treasurer often provides valuable information about the tenants, their use of the land, and financial matters.  </p><p>According to the tenants' leases,  they were required to do the following: to plant apple orchards on the farm (with trees paid for by Harvard) and to prevent horned cattle from damaging the orchards; to clear a given number of acres each year, with the sometime assistance of goats supplied by the College; to pay taxes on the land; to keep the dwelling houses in good repair; to build fences, specifically "good four rail or Virginia fence," and - of course - to pay their rent.  The tenants  often failed to meet these requirements, though, and many of the records in this series concern those failures.  One tenant, Peter Reynolds, was particularly lax in paying his rent, and in 1755 the College had him sent to jail as a consequence.  There were also difficulties in receiving a particular rent payment, made in 1780 in the form of "a thousand weight of cheese,"  because of an embargo against its leaving Rhode Island.  Nicholas Gardner, the tenant trying to transport this cheese to Cambridge, explained that "the state [of Rhode Island] hath an Imbargo on the same that it canot be carried out of the State as you will be informed by a coppy of the act of a sembly published in Newspaper which I send you."</p><p>The records in this series also contain information about the depreciation of paper currency, and the challenges of receiving payments in various currencies ("Spanish Mexico milled dollars,"  Sterling, "lawfull money," Continental dollars, etc.) whose stability fluctuated.    There also appears to have been concern about counterfeit money.  In addition, there are numerous reports on the condition of the farm which include information about the crops being grown, including Indian corn, rye, oats, tobacco, peaches, and apples, and the livestock being raised, which included horned cattle, horses, goats, and sheep.  In addition, there are extensive records related to the January 4, 1809 auction of rights to the farm's timber and the June 23, 1827 auction of the land itself.</p></scopecontent><c><did><unittitle>Deed of gift of Narragansett farm from Samuel Sewall and Hannah Sewall to the President and Fellows of Harvard College, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">June 24, 1696</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 9, Folder 16</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Letter from Francis Willett to Henry Flynt about Narragansett farm, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Jan. 3, 1731</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 11, Folder 12</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Letter from Edward Hutchinson to Benjamin Wadsworth about Stephen Gardner, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">March 18, 1731</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 11, Folder 13</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Henry Flynt’s description of Narragansett farm, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">July 15, 1731</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 4, Folder 85</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Memorandum about Stephen Gardner, tenant at Narragansett farm, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">March 18, 1732</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 4, Folder 86</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Letters from Francis Willett to Edward Hutchinson about Narragansett farm, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">June 3, 1732</unitdate> and <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Aug. 10, 1732</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 11, Folder 14</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>The first letter mentions that a Mrs. Coles is leasing part of Narragansett farm; the second letter explains that Paske Austin hopes to lease the other portion of the farm.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Lease of Narragansett farm to Paske Austin, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">March 25, 1733</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 8, Folder 24</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>The lease is unsigned.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Articles of agreement, draft of lease, and description of house to be built for Paske Austin, tenant of Narragansett farm, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">October 26, 1733</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 4, Folder 87</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Memorandum of agreement with Job Tripp to build a dwelling house on Narragansett farm, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Nov. 5, 1733</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 4, Folder 88</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Vote of President and Fellows appointing a committee to lease part of Narragansett farm to Peter Reynolds, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">August 18, 1735</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 4, Folder 89</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Letter from Francis Willett to Henry Flynt recommending Peter Reynolds as a tenant, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">August 2, 1735</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 4, Folder 90</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>A long addendum was made to the document on August 5, 1735 (by Flynt?).</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Minutes of Agreement with Peter Reynolds regarding tenancy at Narragansett farm, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Sept. 11, 1735</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 4, Folder 91</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Addendum made to the document on October 24, 1738 notes that Reynolds built his house 4 feet wider than had been agreed.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Bond of Peter Reynolds, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Sept. 12, 1735 </unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 4, Folder 92</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Signed by Peter Reynolds, Rebekah Williams and David Collson.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Memorandum regarding Palmer Cleaveland’s wish to lease land on Narragansett farm, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">April 12, 1736</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 4, Folder 93</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Indicates that Cleaveland requested funds to purchase twenty goats.

Although Townsend was within the borders of Massachusetts at the time of the grant, it was determined to be part of New Hampshire when the province line between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was established in 1741, and thus no longer College property.  As an indemnity, the General Court granted another tract of land in Massachusetts to  Harvard in 1765, but that land was re-granted to another party at a later date, overriding the College's  rights to it. This series contains correspondence about the land, several plots drawn by surveyors, bills for survey work, memoranda, and a letter explaining the claim that the land lay in New Hampshire. </p></scopecontent><bibliography><head>References</head><list><item>Drake, Samuel Adams.  <title xlink:type="simple">History of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, containing carefully prepared histories of every city and town in the county.</title> Boston: Estes and Lauriat, 1880.</item></list></bibliography><c><did><unittitle>Corporation vote concerning College land in Townsend, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Oct. 19, 1733</unitdate> and letter from Benjamin Wadsworth, Henry Flynt, and Andrew Bordman to surveyor Samuel Jones, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Nov. 26, 1733</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 6, Folder 54</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>The Corporation appointed Wadsworth, Flynt, and  Bordman as Committee members to deal with College lands in Townsend, and to hire surveyor Samuel Jones to investigate the land on behalf of the College.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Vote of Proprietors of Townsend to appoint a committee to lay out a lot of land for Harvard, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">April 14, 1734</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 6, Folder 55</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Verso reads: “Townshend proprietors vote, recd. of Capt.

The farm was often referred to as Rogers Farm, in honor of the source of the purchasing funds, and it was  leased to generate income.   Although some tenants paid their rent in "lawful silver money," others paid  with beef, pork, Indian corn, cider, butter, cheese, potatoes, rye, oats, barley, melons, squashes, flax, and hay.  Several Harvard employees were among the tenants, including Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy Samuel Williams and College Steward Caleb Gannett.  The other tenants documented in these records were William Hagar, Thomas Dean, Ephraim Pierce (sometimes spelled "Peirce"), Jonathan Sanderson, and Nahum Hardy.  The farm was sold in 1835 for $5,000, which became the Ezekiel Rogers Fund.</p><p>  This series contains records related to the rental of the farm, as well as several plans of the land and buildings drawn by surveyors.  Included are  the 1738 deed of sale from Caverly to Harvard, memoranda about labor performed on the farm by tenants (which was taken into account when determining the rent they owed), leases and minutes for leases, statements of account with tenants and with individuals who made repairs on the property; bonds; memoranda; a certification of taxes made by the Waltham assessors; reports on the farm's production; and accounts of timber from the farm either sold or brought to the Harvard wood-yard.</p><p>Of note in this series are two  documents created by John Hancock during his tenure as Treasurer of Harvard College.</p></scopecontent><c><did><unittitle>Manuscript copy of deed of mortgage, Anthony Caverly to James Smith, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Oct. 15, 1737</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 6, Folder 68</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>This document appears to have been copied for Edward Hutchinson on Aug. 11, 1740.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Lease of Waltham farm to William Hagar, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">March 25, 1738</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 11, Folder 17</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Signed by John Caverly, John Larrabee, and Edward Hutchinson.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Deed of sale for Waltham farm, Anthony Caverly to the President and Fellows of Harvard College, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">April 4, 1738</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Oversize cabinet, Folder 9</unitid></did><scopecontent><p>Harvard paid “two thousand pounds in good bills of publick credit” for the farm.</p></scopecontent></c><c><did><unittitle>Certification of Anthony Caverly’s April 1738 sale of Waltham farm to the President and Fellows of Harvard College, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">Aug. 8, 1741</unitdate></unittitle><unitid> UAI 15.750 Box 6, Folder 69</unitid></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Manuscript copy of minutes of agreement with Jos.

The tract, which was thereafter called Coggan's Marsh, was located within the larger Rumney Marsh, and the College leased it to generate income.

Robbins.</p><p>Former Massachusetts Governor William Stoughton (1631-1701) also gave a parcel of marsh  to the College; this bequest of approximately 5 acres of marsh land in Dorchester was finalized in 1702, the year after his death, and was thenceforward called Stoughton's Marsh.  Stoughton specified that income from the marsh, along with income from Stoughton's Pasture (See Series XVIII) should be used to finance scholarships "in the first place, to a scholar of the town of Dorchester, and if there be none such, to one of the town of Milton, and if in want of such, then to any other well deserving, that shall be most needy."</p></bioghist><bibliography><head>References</head><list><item>Peirce, Benjamin.  <title xlink:type="simple">A History of Harvard University.</title> Cambridge, Mass.: Brown, Shattuck, and Company, 1833.</item></list></bibliography><scopecontent><p>Records related to both Coggan's Marsh and Stoughton's Marsh are in this series, because several documents pertain to both parcels of land.
