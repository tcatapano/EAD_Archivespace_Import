<bioghist id="a2" encodinganalog="5450_"><head>Biographical Note:</head><p>
		  William L. Ford graduated from the University of Michigan law school in 1900
		  and began practicing law in White Sulphur Springs, Montana, in the same year.
		  In 1904 he ran for Meagher County attorney and was defeated by N.B. Smith. In
		  1905 he became the city attorney and clerk, and in 1906 was elected county
		  attorney, a postion he held through 1912. He decided not to run for re-election
		  in November of that year due to his father's illness. He devoted his time to
		  running his father's ranch near White Sulphur Springs, and by 1913 had formed a
		  partnership with Richard Manger. In 1918 or 1919 Ford renewed his law practice.
		  He was elected district judge as a Republican in 1920. He had been active in
		  the Masons and the Republican Party before his election, having been appointed
		  county chairman of the Roosevelt Memorial Association in 1919 and chairman of
		  the Republican Ways and Means Committee for Meagher County in 1920. William
		  Ford married his wife Margaret on December 25, 1907.</p><p> Carl August Linn
		  joined William Ford's law office in March 1912. While retaining the name of
		  "Ford and Linn," Linn began operating as the firm's sole attorney when Ford
		  turned his attention to ranching in 1912. Linn was elected county attorney in
		  November 1912. </p><p> Ford and Linn acted as collection agents for
		  out-of-state and in-state firms and individuals. They also handled cases
		  involving property disputes, water rights, sales of horses, claims involving
		  the Montana Railroad Company and the Northern Pacific Railroad, divorce,
		  probate, assault, etc., and collected rents for out-of-town landlords.

<scopecontent id="a3" encodinganalog="5202_"><p>The collection is divided into
		  three series: general correspondence (1900-192O, n.d.), subject files (1948,
		  n.d.), and miscellany (1917-1919).</p><p> The collection consists almost
		  entirely of the outgoing and incoming correspondence, arranged chronologically,
		  of William L. Ford and Carl August Linn in their capacity as private attorneys.
		  There is some correspondence directed to them, and to which they responded, as
		  county attorneys. Also included in the correspondence are a few incoming
		  letters (1904) to Max Waterman (Ford's predecessor as county attorney) and from
		  Ford's brother Arthur and his sister Ida. The rest of the correspondence is
		  from clients, other attorneys, judges, the Montana attorney general, and
		  landlords whose properties Ford and Linn handled.</p><p> The subject file
		  concerns the Meagher County Health Council, an organization established by the
		  Meagher County Planning Board to persuade a physician and dentist to take up
		  practice in Meagher County, sponsor a health clinic, sponsor health education
		  programs, etc. </p><p> The miscellany consists of William Ford's Mason
		  membership cards and a receipt for Ford's attorney annual license
		  tax.</p></scopecontent>
