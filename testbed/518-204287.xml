            <head>Records History </head>
            <p> During the first years of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT), each of the
                colleges that comprised CIT employed their own teachers of academic humanities
                subjects -- Economics, English, History, Mathematics, Modern Languages, and
                Psychology. In 1917, a planned restructuring brought teachers of like subjects
                together into a Central Faculty. World War I prevented implementation of the
                restructuring until 1919, at which time the Central Faculty was renamed the Division
                of Academic Studies. Shortly thereafter, the administration approved a name change
                to the Division of General Studies. </p>
            <p>Most viewed the Division as a "service" unit, providing academic humanities courses
                for male students pursuing degrees in the "technical" Divisions of Science and
                Engineering Arts, Industries, or Applied Psychology. The final Division, Margaret
                Morrison Carnegie College, provided liberal arts courses for women. </p>

            <p>In 1941, the Division of General Studies was reorganized into the Division of
                Humanistic and Social Studies. Reorganization provided an opportunity for the new
                Division to overcome the "service" niche in which General Studies had existed. By
                1950, the new Division had become a vital part of Carnegie Tech. Students from other
                Divisions were increasingly taking more humanities courses. This was especially true
                of the female students at Margaret Morrison. In the 1950s, there was a concerted
                effort to integrate Margaret Morrison and Engineering and Science students into H
                and SS courses. In 1962, the administration approved another name change. The
                Division of Humanistic and Social Studies became the Division of Humanities and
                Social Sciences. </p>


            <p>In 1967, discussion of a "new college for Carnegie Tech" began. Efforts were made to
                bring the humanities departments together into a cohesive unit and the first class
                of the "New College" entered in September 1969. However, problems plagued the
                program from the start and it did not long survive. </p>
            <p>During the mid-1970s, the administration took steps to reorganize the collection of
                departments they had recently acknowledged as the College of Humanities and Social
                Sciences. The various departments, in truth, had become disjointed, haphazard, and
                were lacking a common goal. The reorganization of the mid-1970s also included women
                who would have attended Margaret Morrison, for the college had graduated its last
                class in the spring of 1969. </p>
            <p>The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the development of a core curriculum and the
                adoption of the phrase "liberal professional education" as an integral part of the
                mission of the College. The core curriculum and defined mission aided departments in
                establishing a base on which the College could grow. Statistics formally joined the
                College in 1981. Philosophy separated from History, becoming its own department, in
                1985. The Education Center, which had operated within the college for approximately
                15 years, was given a university-wide mission and renamed the University Teaching
                Center. The academic departments within the College underwent reviews by outside
                visiting committees during the late 1980s and early 1990s. These efforts were made
                as an effort to upgrade the image of the College.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p> This collection contains records of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences which 
                are arranged in three series; Series 1: College of Humanities and Social Science, which 
                contains records created by the College as a whole; Series 2: Departments, which contains 
                records produced by the Economics, English, History, Philosophy, Modern Languages, 
                Political Science, Psychology, Social Science, and Statistics departments, as well as some 
                records from the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College; and Series 3: Publications, which 
                houses publications produced by the departments of English and History. The collection 
                spans the period from 1913 through 1999. Except for annual reports, the records are rather 
                lacking from the early years through the 1940s. There are increasingly more records from 
                the 1950s. The bulk of the records span the 1960s through the 1980s. There are a limited 
                number of records from the 1990s.</p>
