		  O'DONNELL</head> 
		<p>Gerald James O'Donnell was born November 24, 1898, the fifth of eight
		  children born to Pat and Ellen O'Donnell. O'Donnell lived his entire life in
		  St. Paul, Minnesota, growing up in a home located at 373 Harrison Avenue (now
		  torn down to make way for Interstate 35E) and residing most of his adult life
		  at 1875 Worcester Avenue. O'Donnell attended the Cretin School through the
		  eighth grade and worked several years as a clerk and a driver before beginning
		  his career in steamfitting. In 1917 he met his future wife, Evelyn Simon, on
		  the corner of St. Clair and West Seventh. The couple were married in 1921 and
		  later had two daughters, Lois and Geraldine. </p> 
		<p>O'Donnell's lifelong association with the labor movement began in 1918
		  when he started an apprenticeship in the steamfitting-pipefitting trade through
		  the United Association local No. 455, AFL. He became a journeyman in 1925. With
		  the exception of a few years during the depression when he didn't have enough
		  money to pay dues, O'Donnell was an active member of the Steamfitters Local 455
		  for the next sixty years of his life, serving as vice chairman, chairman, on
		  the executive board, and as business manager for thirty years. One of his
		  proudest achievements was the institution of an apprenticeship program in Local
		  455, the first such training program for young pipefitters in the area.</p> 
		<p>In addition to his work for the local, he served in many offices in
		  the labor movement at the state and national level, including twenty years as
		  vice president of the Minnesota State Federation of Labor and eighteen years on
		  the United Association Industrial Relations Council for the plumbing and
		  pipefitting industry (he was elected vice chairman of the council in 1961). He
		  was a member of numerous union trades councils and served as president of the
		  St. Paul Trades and Labor Assembly central body for nine years and as president
		  of the Minnesota Pipe Trades Association for twenty years. In later years, he
		  founded the retiree's chapter of Local 455 and was chairman of the St. Paul
		  Trades and Labor Assembly's retirees' chapter. In the words of his daughter,
		  Geraldine O'Donnell O'Keefe, "his overriding love was for the union -- the
		  union -- the union. He ate union and slept union and breathed union. He had it
		  in his blood." </p> 
		<p> O'Donnell was active in St. Paul civic affairs and in the DFL party.
		  He was chairman of the 4th District DFL for six years and served on the state
		  central and Democratic National committees as well as various campaign
		  committees. </p> 
		<p>Gerald O'Donnell died on November 22nd, 1985, just days before his
		  eighty-seventh birthday. He was preceded in death by his wife Evelyn, who
		  passed away in 1958. </p> 
		<p>Biographical information was taken from published obituaries and
		  materials in the collection.</p>

		<p>Biographical information, personal and union correspondence, subject
		  files, desk diaries, and photographs documenting O'Donnell's career as a
		  Minnesota labor and DFL Party leader.</p> 
		<p>The papers document his career in organized labor as a member (1918- )
		  and business agent (1937-1966) of St. Paul Local 455 of the Steam Pipe Fitters
		  union, chairman of the St. Paul Trades and Labor Assembly (1940-1949),
		  president of the Minnesota State Pipe Trades Association, member of the
		  Industrial Relations Council for the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Trades, and vice
		  president of the Minnesota AFL-CIO. They document his work on behalf of many
		  St. Paul civic organizations, including the Community Chest, and as an active
		  member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, including his chairmanship of the
		  Ramsey County-Fourth District DFL organization (1950s), his service on the
		  state central committee and various campaign committees, and his participation
		  in Democratic National Committee programs.</p>
